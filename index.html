      <strong>Investment analyst/portfolio manager</strong><br>
      <strong>Demand:</strong><br>
      The demand in job roles like this are expected to grow in the next 3 years with growth projected to be from 62,100 jobs in 2021 to 68,800
      jobs in 2026 (labour market insights, 2021). Labour market insights (2021) also show that 84% of the workers in these roles are working
      full-time hours. This suggests that not only is the demand for the job in good shape but also the number of hours involved in the job will
      be sufficient for it to be the sole income. <br><br>

      <strong>Required skills:</strong><br>
      The average age for people working in roles like these is 42 and over 80% of people working in the field hold at least a diploma.
      Some of the most sort after skills for these roles are reading comprehension, speaking, active listening and critical thinking
      (Labour Market Insights 2021). Some of the IT crossover skills required by these roles include but are not limited to, communication using
      media, telecommunications, and utilising electronics to record and document data (Labour Market Insights 2021). <br><br>

      <strong>Reflection based on industry data:</strong><br>
      After researching the job role in more detail, I can say that my interest in the job role has not changed. The growth indicated in the report
      and the large number of hours offered by such roles gives me the confidence to pursue this type of role as a career path. The average age of
      workers being 42 also helps with my goals as I can set myself a 10-year career goal to achieve this type of role. <br><br>

      <strong>Principal / Staff Software Engineer</strong><br>
      <strong>Demand</strong>
      <p>
        As the Principal and Staff titles in Software Engineering are usually based on seniority and not specific occupations – the following analysis will focus on the Software Engineer / Programmer occupation. From data dated 2021, growth of 27% is expected for software engineer roles in Australia by 2026 (Labour Market Insights, 2021). Additionally, the unemployment rate for this role is below average, suggesting that there is strong demand for people with the necessary skills and experience to perform in this role.
      </p>
      <strong>Required Skills</strong>
      <p>
        Reflecting upon many current active job postings on Seek.com.au in the Developers and Programmers category each role is often specific to the technology used by the employer, but some common skills found on each of these postings include collaboration, strong analytical skills, and strong problem-solving skills. All job posting require hands on experience with at least one programming language. Interestingly, a small portion of job postings were not specific with which languages they were hiring for – suggesting that employers are willing to hire for language agnostic developers. Roles also required additional technical skills such as experience working with databases, infrastructure, or security.
      </p>
      <strong>Reflection on industry data</strong>
      <p>
        Reviewing the industry data alongside current job postings on Seek.com.au, it seems to suggest that the industry data last updated in 2021 is accurate, with developers and programmers being one of the categories with the most current job postings in the Information Technology category. Additionally, it is interesting to see that there is strong demand across not only Full Stack Developer roles, but also Front-End Developer roles and Back End Developer roles.

      <strong>Security Ops:</strong><br>
      A day in the life of a cyber security analyst starts a lot like most jobs, checking emails for any priority tasks. Morning meetings are incorporated
      into the day to day to collaborate with the team and see how everyone is traveling with their tasks. The types of projects a cybersecurity analyst
      will work on varies, some may answer calls from existing clients and investigate problems/implement fixes. Other jobs can be working on benchmark
      security protocols specific to a project or client and make them available online. Throughout the day analysts will check the Endpoint Detection &
      Response (EDR) which monitors the traffic on the network for any malicious activity. As an analyst continues to improve their skills, they can advance
      in their career to start working on firewalls and switching and routing. This is usually configuring the firewalls, switches and routers and optimising
      their effectiveness (Day In The Life Of A Cyber Security Analyst. It's Probably Not What You Thought, Or Is It..... - YouTube ;
      A Day in the Life of a Cybersecurity Analyst - $120k Salary - YouTube ) <br><br>
      </p>

      <strong>Software Engineer</strong>
      <p>
        As uncovered in the industry insights section of this report, the role of a Software Engineer is incredibly varied depending on the company they work for, the industry they’re in and what type of software development they do. Typically, a Software Engineer works as an individual contributor, taking on multiple tasks they have either been assigned by their manager or through a central project management and collaboration software tool such as Jira or Trello. The types of tasks a developer might do include implementing feature requests, investigating and solving bugs in software, writing documentation, and designing and architecting new software systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Software Engineers and Developers are the individuals writing code and implementing features and bug fixes, taking a software project from ideation to the end user is not single handedly performed by developers, with interactions by UI / UX Designers, Product Managers and Project Managers all common. The most common type of challenge experienced by people working as software developers is solving complex bugs that are hard to reproduce, or when a project is taking longer to complete than expected and having to spend some time working later than expected to meet the deadline. In some of the videos reviewed, interviewing candidates was often referenced in their day-to-day activities, affirming that there is a lot of demand from employers to hire people into these roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many companies who employ software engineers have introduced flexible working arrangements including working from home or hybrid work. This means that software engineers and the other people they interact with often have the freedom to work from where they are most comfortable, with a mix of working from home and spending some time in the office for some of the week being anecdotally a common choice.

      <Strong>Clouds, Services, Servers</Strong><br>

      <Strong>What does it do? </Strong><br>

      Cloud computing has revolutionised the way businesses and individuals manage and process their data. Cloud
      computing has paved the way for scalable, efficient, flexible and cost effective enterprise computing environments
      (Thecodest, 2023). The technology has and continues to rapidly develop over the years, offering a plethora of
      services and enabling more computing possibilities. At their core, clouds are large, interconnected servers that
      are accessible through the internet (Cloudflare, 2023). They allow users to access a shared pool of resources.
      Clouds provide on-demand access to resources, eliminating the need for local infrastructure and reducing setup
      costs dramatically. Cloud computing offers scalability which allows businesses to expand their computing resources
      on demand as needed.<br><br>

      There are a range of different offerings that are available from cloud computing, including Infrastructure as a
      Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtual computing
      resources which allow users to provision and manage virtual machines, storage servers and networks. PaaS allows
      developers to build, test and deploy applications in a scalable environment. SaaS houses ready to use software
      that can easily be setup and deployed (Watts & Raza, 2019). <br><br>

      There are a number of large scale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google
      Cloud Platform who each have infrastructure and data centres located around the globe. Between all these
      providers, they offer a variety of services from storage and virtual machines to advanced analytics and artificial
      intelligence capabilities. <br><br>

      Today, cloud computing allows organisations to leverage data analytics, machine learning and artificial
      intelligence to gain insights on their products. The benefits of doing this on the cloud means that businesses can
      process large volumes of data quickly, which allows them to be more productive. The cloud also allows for seamless
      collaboration with teams allowing for remote teams to work and access shared resources from anywhere in the world
      with an internet connection. <br><br>

      Over the next couple of years, there are several advancements in cloud computing that are expected to
      revolutionise it. Cloud computing providers are expected to increase their scalability even more, allowing
      businesses to seamlessly scale their computing resources on demand. <br><br>

      Cloud based Advance AI and Machine Learning services will become even more sophisticated and faster, allowing
      organisations to leverage powerful algorithms and predictive insights (7MA, 2021). This will help in various
      sectors including medicine, autonomous vehicles and automation. As technology like Quantum computing develops,
      cloud providers will be sure to integrate its capabilities into their services. <br><br>

      Over the next few years, we will see more organisations starting to adopt a hybrid cloud model, where they are
      able to utilise the benefits of cloud computing whilst also having their important data stored locally for quicker
      access. <br><br>

      Cloud computing will also play a vital role in promoting sustainability as providers continue to invest in energy
      efficient infrastructure, renewable energy sources and carbon offset initiatives to minimize their environmental
      impact (Beardmore, 2022). By also enabling organisations to allow remote work, they also reduce the environmental
      impacts from needing to commute. <br><br>

      Cloud computing has transformed the way in which businesses and individuals handle their data, offering on demand
      scalability, flexible and cost efficient computing environments. Cloud computing has and continues to become a
      integral part of modern technology. <br><br>


      <strong>What is the likely impact? </strong><br>

      Cloud computing continues to have an impact on the technology landscape, continuously changing the way businesses
      and individuals manage and utilize computing resources. It eliminates the need for companies to continue to have
      on site infrastructure. The cloud also allows for seamless remote working environments as it provides centralised
      access to applications, data and resources. This will allow for businesses to shift from needing employees to come
      into a physical office to allowing remote workers located anywhere in the world to work on projects. <br><br>

      In the coming years, traditional on site IT departments will start to become obsolete, with no need for companies
      to have a dedicated team managing the on site infrastructure as it will predominantly be cloud based (Solutions,
      2022). Instead of managing an organisations hardware and software internally, companies will be able to outsource
      these tasks to cloud service providers making on site IT techs redundant. While Cloud Computing will take away
      some jobs in IT, it will also create new cloud based ones as all the cloud equipment will need to be replaced.
      <br><br>

      Advancements in cloud computing will also replace a number of jobs due to the streamlined and seamless automation
      capabilities that it can provide. Self driving vehicles and drones will inevitably replace the taxi and delivery
      industries, while AI will replace financial planners and accountants making them redundant. <br><br> 
      <strong>How will this affect you? </strong><br>

      Cloud computing has already had a significant impact on my life. As someone that currently works in the IT field,
      my life currently involves utilizing cloud computing daily. Cloud computing enables me to access my own and my
      teams data and applications from anywhere in the world with an internet connection, meaning that both me and my
      team have the convenience of working remotely as we please. Sharing files with my clients is also very easy as all
      the data is already accessible through the internet and I only need to grant them access (there is no waiting for
      uploads). Cloud Computing also provides me with the convenience of an offsite and onsite backup which
      automatically sync with each other, reducing our risk of data loss. <br><br>

      My family members have also been affected by cloud services at their work. My mum’s work has recently shifted to
      using cloud services to host their applications, giving them more flexibility on remote working, which allows my
      mum to travel to visit her parents and work from their house as she pleases! <br><br>

      <Strong>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</Strong><br>

      <Strong>What does it do? </Strong><br>

      The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was created by either a programmer or a group of programmers using the
      name Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of the creator of Bitcoin is still to this day unknown (Pinkerton 2023).
      Cryptocurrency is a digital currency which can’t be materialised and uses decentralised control. This means that
      transactions are strictly between the parties involved, there are no intermediaries facilitating the transactions
      such as banks like the normal monetary system and parties remain completely anonymous. This allows users to buy and
      sell things with little to no fees and is the main reason why interest in crypto is growing every year
      (Hassani et al. 2018). <br><br>

      For these transactions to function and maintain security, a blockchain is used. A blockchain is basically a digital
      storage of transactions. These transactions are replicated and sent to a network of nodes to record all the information,
      verify it, and then create a block which is added to the chain. A block in a blockchain stores a certain number of
      transactions, then another block is created and distributed to all participants in the node network (Duggan 2022).
      Each transaction must be verified through digital signatures from each party involved in the transaction. These
      signatures are in the form of private and public keys. The keys are unique identifiers for each party which acts like a
      password and once each party has entered their keys the transaction is sent to all verification nodes. <br><br>

      These nodes are operated by people that have been incentivised to verify transactions with the potential for rewards,
      they are known as crypto miners (Duggan 2022). Crypto mining is where you get specialised computers to conduct calculation
      which are used to record and verify every new crypto transaction. Mining is essentially a race between all participants.
      Each time a transaction occurs it is sent to nodes for verification. To verify the transactions, you need to guess a hash,
      which is a 64-digit hexadecimal number. Whoever guesses the number first updates the blockchain with a new block containing
      the newly verified transactions and in return they also receive a bitcoin or a unit of the cryptocurrency they are mining
      (Coinbase n.d). As the blockchain is shared between all nodes in the network, it makes it hard for fraudulent activity to
      occur because everyone can see the transaction, and everyone is trying to verify it. <br><br>

      The spike in crypto popularity has given rise to new lending, borrowing and trading opportunities known as DeFi. DeFi or
      decentralized finance offers financial services much like banks but in the form of cryptocurrency. This is becoming more
      popular because it often reduces the fees and commissions you would otherwise pay if you went through a bank
      (Siripurapu and Berman 2023). The popularity of cryptocurrency has produced growing concerns within governments as the currency
      has no regulations. With no regulations the door to criminal activity is wide open with no way to track transactions to the
      individuals. <br><br>

      The federal reserve bank is considering making their own form of digital currency that acts very similar to cryptocurrency with
      an attempt to add some regulation to reduce risks (Siripurapu and Berman 2023). The problem with this idea is that the popularity
      comes from the fact that cryptocurrency is decentralised (Hassani et al. 2018). So, a form of digital currency produced by the
      centralised bank may not be welcomed by already users of crypto. Cryptocurrencies are also increasing in acceptance by the retail
      industry, with more retailers accepting crypto as payment for goods and services (Finance Magnates 2023). If the trend continues
      it is going to put more pressure on existing financial institutions to come up with a response or risk being pushed out of the market. <br><br>

      <strong>What is the likely impact? </strong><br>

      Some impacts of the rise of crypto are that it has created a platform for criminal activity such as ransomware attacks, which
      involve shutting down networks and demanding payment to restore them and drug cartels laundering money through virtual currencies,
      utilising the anonymous nature of the transactions. The reaction to these activities by the US government is to monitor the
      transactions of crypto back to the US dollar (Siripurapu and Berman 2023). This negative impact will see the need for authorities
      to find new ways of being able to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies. <br><br>

      Another impact is user error. While it's said that blockchains are impossible to hack, your crypto wallet is only as safe as
      your seed phrases. Seed phrases are generated by your crypto wallet and then are used to derive your private keys which allow
      you to make a transaction (Duggan 2022). If someone was to acquire these phrases, for example, if you write them down and someone
      finds it, then that person will be able to use those phrases to steal all your currency. If you were to forget these phrases, then
      you would not be able to access your crypto and it is all essentially worthless. Wallets can also be “cold” which is the closest
      you can get to physically holding the currency. This involves depositing your crypto into a physical hardware device which is then
      turned off when you are not using it (Duggan 2022). If something were to happen to this cold wallet, then all the currency inside
      is lost. <br><br>

      In contrast to your standard wallet with your bank card, if you lose your bank card, you can contact your financial institute report
      it stolen and have a new card delivered within a week. In my personal experience when money has been stolen out of my bank account,
      my financial institute has refunded the amount in full. If someone steals your wallet, has your passwords and spends your currency,
      there is no way of recovering any of it. With these points in mind the people that will be impacted firstly are households and
      businesses looking to loan, lend or invest money. With the growth in DeFi it is likely that more people will transition from regular
      financial institutions for the cheaper fees and commissions. The financial institutions themselves will also be impacted, if they
      lose more customers then they may cut employees due to lower demand for services. Finally, law enforcement will be impacted with a
      growing need for more eyes on the crypto criminal element, so as potential jobs are lost in the financial sector, there would be
      potential job growth in law enforcement. <br><br>

      <strong>How will this affect you? </strong><br>

      On an individual level the impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies are going to be quite small. This will affect people differently
      according to how tech savvy they are. <br><br>

      Starting with the young generation, they have grown up with technology and know how to search the web and network with peers to figure
      out how to use crypto wallets and any security precautions needed. We, the young generation, have grown up in a world where everything
      is online, we already know how to contactless pay and live cash free, so if the world were to move more in the crypto direction,
      it will not affect us too much. <br><br>

      Middle-aged society may be a little more affected. Most of the middle-ages people I know can be quite stubborn with the old way of
      doing things, so they might hang on to the old way, not participate in learning the new technology and potentially lack security for
      their wallets if crypto became the mainstream currency. <br><br>

      The last group of people to think of in the scope of changing to crypto is the elderly. I know from speaking to elderly from my family
      that they are more likely to be targeted by scammers through emails and texts with links. So, if the elderly are targets now with the
      current banking and financial system, you can imagine how they will be targeted in a cryptocurrency world. I know some elderly people
      that barely know how to turn their phones on, and we expect them to be able to use seed phrases to generate keys just to buy some
      groceries? Furthermore, as discussed earlier, if your crypto is stolen or you lose access, all the crypto is lost. You can’t trace the
      theft back to anyone, you can’t recover the crypto from another device or wallet, it’s just gone. So, the elderly person makes one tiny
      mistake which is likely to occur to some and they pay the ultimate price. <br><br>

      <strong>Natural Language Processing & Chatterbots</strong>

      <p>
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that primarily encompasses software that enables computers to understand text and speech like the way humans do (IBM, n.d.). While NLP is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, the applications for Natural Language Processing are almost infinite – with any task involving the parsing of text or speech by a human and then acting on that information having the potential to be completed by using Natural Language processing techniques. As Natural Language Processing is a wide and complex field, this report will be focusing on text-based NLP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Natural Language Processing has roots in linguistics, with the understanding of context and nuances of language being the focus. Early uses of NLP were rule based, with systems and solutions fitted to specific applications. One of the earliest rule-based approaches to NLP was IBM’s Georgetown experiment, where a typist entered phrases in Russian into a computer and had the computer translate these back in English. (IBM, 1954). This was made possible by assigning rule tags to words in order to signal to the computer that a specific action needed to be applied, this could include reversing words, removing words that aren’t necessary and inserting new words. As an example, a rule tag 21 was used to signal to the computer that the Russian words “gyeneral major” should be reversed to “major general” in English. (IBM, 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
        As rule-based translation requires significant work by hand to understand language and craft rulesets, advances in computing technology unlocked newer methods of translation, particularly with Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). SMT shifted from relying on hand crafted rulesets to leveraging large texts and statistical models to generate probability based translations. IBM’s Candide system for translating French to English is one example of applying statistical methods to translate from one language to another. The model for Candide is comprised of ingesting English and French sentence pairs from the Canadian Hansard, an English-French record of the Canadian Parliament (Berger, et al. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
        While statistical machine translation performs well when there is corpus available for the language pairs, it only works for specific pairs of languages such as the above example with English and French while less common language pairs have less reference data available, making statistical models hard to generate. Fortunately, further developments in Artificial Intelligence and particularly the development of the Transformer architecture for neural networks have had a major impact on the field of Natural Language Processing. The Transformer architecture is multiple layers of neural network mechanisms and components that work together to process an input and allow the model to contextualise the input it has received, allowing it to further recognize patterns and relationships in data. (Kulshresthra, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, developments in Natural Language Processing leveraging the Transformer architecture have been made available to the public with immediate impact. OpenAI’s GPT-3 (Generative Pre Trained Transformer 3) is a Large-Language-Model that has been trained on extensive and diverse datasets that amass to around 45TB of data and 175 billion parameters (Cooper, 2021). This has resulted in a chat-based product, Chat GPT - that is able to understand and generate text like a human would. A user of Chat GPT can provide the software with prompts containing contextual information, reference data or direction on what the user wants Chat GPT to do. It can, for example, take in a large text reference and summarise it for a user. It can also generate code in multiple programming languages. The implications of this technology are widespread, transformative, and potentially, completely unknown. (Mollick, 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost immediately, the impacts of releasing Chat GPT to the public were causing both tremendous excitement and concern for the future. The Education sector was one of the first industries to be affected by this emerging technology with schools having to rapidly learn both how their students were using this technology and how they can shape learning in the future to be enhanced by it (Roose, 2023). Professionals have also found success with using Chat GPT to automate their day-to-day tasks such as analysing data, responding to emails and creating content for their work.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all the success of time and effort saved by automating day-to-day tasks, the negatives of this emerging technology are starting to become visible with the fear of jobs being replaced by AI becoming a closer threat. IBM recently paused hiring in back-office type roles such as human resources as they expect with the improvements to the technology over time, AI could replace over 7000 employees (Edwards, 2023). As more people are aware of the potential dangers of more widespread AI adoption, criticism over who should be allowed to develop and control these models has become a hot topic recently. The European Union have recently called for regulation, with their AI Act aiming to ensure safety and transparency in artificial intelligence technical, and to prevent harmful outcomes ensuring that systems are overseen by humans. (European Parliament, 2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I have used Chat GPT to look for a bug in code that I’ve written or explain why a unit test isn’t working and provide suggestions on how to fix it - this has saved me countless hours of frustration, enabling me to be more efficient in my day-to-day work. I also see a lot of opportunities for this technology to enhance the working lives of many people close to me - my partner who spends a lot of their time as a lawyer reviewing documents and case files could use this technology to summarise these documents for them, providing an improved work life balance. I have witnessed new folks in the software development industry using Chat GPT as a pair programmer to help them understand new languages and frameworks quicker.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 2023 Open AI released their latest model, GPT 4 - which reported has 1 trillion parameters up from the 175 billion parameters which GPT 3 was trained on (Albergotti, 2023). As Chat GPT is currently using GPT 3.5, it is hard to predict what impact this new model will have on the world. Personally, I am concerned what the future holds for my profession and what Natural Language Processing and Large-Language Models such as GPT have on it. I hope that this technology enhances output and unlocks a more productive society, and not make software development by humans redundant like the calculator did to human calculators.

      <strong>Nicholas</strong></br>
      In my opinion the Gravy Seals team worked great together throughout this assignment. We divided tasks among
      ourselves and checked in with each other often to ensure that we met our deadlines. Our team members were very
      cooperative, easy going and pleasant to work with. Our communication was good, allowing for everyone to express
      their ideas and provide feedback when necessary. During our meetings we had good discussions with each other and
      our diverse backgrounds and experiences helped with the success on completing this assignment. <br><br>

      There were a few challenges along the way. As our team is scattered around Australia and we all have various work
      commitments we were not always able to meet as a team. We tried to find a time that everyone was available to meet
      but were not always successful. Despite this, we overcame this by ensuring that our meetings were recorded and
      requested that members who were not present make comments on the recordings at their earliest convenience. The
      Gravy Seals team has been great to work with and I look forward to continuing to work with them on the next
      assignment. <br><br>
      <strong>Jayson</strong><br>
      In my opinion this group was very organised with strong meeting leadership by Angus and also strong daily updates by
      Keaton when leading up to the submission which helped all people stay on track. All of the large sections were split
      up in order to assign a fair workload to each member of the team. It was also great that meetings were kept short and
      concise so that if a meeting was missed by a member they could look at the recording and obtain all of the important
      information clearly and easily.<br><br>

      We were set with challenges as any group should be, particularly being time zone issues and late work shifts, to which
      I am an offender. However, with good leadership and positive attitudes we managed to stay on track and stay as
      communicative as possible given the circumstances.<br><br>

      <strong>Nathan:</strong><br>
      The group started off a little slow which was expected with an online group as we had to try and figure out the best
      time to meet up for our weekly meetings. We intentionally allocated a small amount of work for the first week just
      while we figured out a good meeting plan. By the time the second meeting happened though the gravy seals were in full
      swing. We divided large segments of the report between the group members and set the one-week deadline. From this
      point on the group worked like a well-greased machine with members not only finishing their tasks but also going out
      of their way to start the next task. <br><br>

      Our meetings were short, but they got straight to the point as we had discussions leading into meetings addressing
      what we were going to talk about. I enjoy our meetings as it creates a more friendly environment where we have had a
      few laughs rather than just relying on texting back and forth which can be quite boring. I am overall happy that our
      team got together and am excited to see how our team project will evolve leading into assignment 3. <br><br>

      <strong>Keaton</strong>
      <p>
        I felt that our group the Gravy Seals has worked well together – coordinating times between 5 people across Australia is no easy feat with different time zones, schedules and lifestyles all playing a part. We had a great mix of both synchronous engagement and asynchronous engagement – allowing everyone to participate in whichever way they felt the most comfortable. Surprisingly, each team member showed initiative and was able to carry a portion of the project on their own without being directed, which is a breath of fresh air compared to some past experiences in group projects. While we all have different schedules, we’re all invested in making our deadline.
      </p>

      <strong>Collective Reflection (Group)</strong>
      <p>
        Overall, the Gravy Seals team had a successful working experience throughout the assignment. The team formed quickly, and self-organised to schedule meetings to start the project. The team found working together to be a positive experience, with members reflecting that each team member contributed fairly and were able to not only complete their assigned tasks, but also ensure the project was moving forward. The team checked in regularly asynchronously on Teams and met twice a week. Our effective communication allowed us to meet our deadline and foster a cooperative working environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, it was a slower start as we navigated scheduling an initial meeting that worked for everyone's schedule. However, we were able to make a start on our project by filling in various sections from Assessment 1 whilst we waited to meet. Once we established our meeting schedule and started allocating our work, the team was able to complete individual tasks assigned and show imitative to ensure the project was progressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        One surprising aspect of our collaboration was the individual initiative demonstrated by our team members. We have all had past experiences of group projects where only one or two members are pulling all the weight, but in this project, everyone had an equal share and were bought into the success of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lessons learned from this project include the importance of communication, especially when everyone is on a different schedule and has their own life commitments outside of schooling. We also learned that people work effectively in different ways and allowing each team member the space to work in the way that best suited them paid off for our team.
