      <Strong>Clouds, Services, Servers</Strong><br>

<Strong>What does it do? </Strong><br>

Cloud computing has revolutionised the way businesses and individuals manage and process their data. Cloud computing has paved the way for scalable, efficient, flexible and cost effective enterprise computing environments (Thecodest, 2023). The technology has and continues to rapidly develop over the years, offering a plethora of services and enabling more computing possibilities. At their core, clouds are large, interconnected servers that are accessible through the internet (Cloudflare, 2023).   They allow users to access a shared pool of resources. Clouds provide on-demand access to resources, eliminating the need for local infrastructure and reducing setup costs dramatically. Cloud computing offers scalability which allows businesses to expand their computing resources on demand as needed.<br><br>

There are a range of different offerings that are available from cloud computing, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtual computing resources which allow users to provision and manage virtual machines, storage servers and networks. PaaS allows developers to build, test and deploy applications in a scalable environment. SaaS houses ready to use software that can easily be setup and deployed (Watts & Raza, 2019). <br><br>

There are a number of large scale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform who each have infrastructure and data centres located around the globe. Between all these providers, they offer a variety of services from storage and virtual machines to advanced analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities. <br><br>

Today, cloud computing allows organisations to leverage data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence to gain insights on their products. The benefits of doing this on the cloud means that businesses can process large volumes of data quickly, which allows them to be more productive. The cloud also allows for seamless collaboration with teams allowing for remote teams to work and access shared resources from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. <br><br>

Over the next couple of years, there are several advancements in cloud computing that are expected to revolutionise it. Cloud computing providers are expected to increase their scalability even more, allowing businesses to seamlessly scale their computing resources on demand. <br><br>

Cloud based Advance AI and Machine Learning services will become even more sophisticated and faster, allowing organisations to leverage powerful algorithms and predictive insights (7MA, 2021). This will help in various sectors including medicine, autonomous vehicles and automation. As technology like Quantum computing develops, cloud providers will be sure to integrate its capabilities into their services. <br><br>

Over the next few years, we will see more organisations starting to adopt a hybrid cloud model, where they are able to utilise the benefits of cloud computing whilst also having their important data stored locally for quicker access. <br><br>

Cloud computing will also play a vital role in promoting sustainability as providers continue to invest in energy efficient infrastructure, renewable energy sources and carbon offset initiatives to minimize their environmental impact (Beardmore, 2022). By also enabling organisations to allow remote work, they also reduce the environmental impacts from needing to commute.  <br><br>

Cloud computing has transformed the way in which businesses and individuals handle their data, offering on demand scalability, flexible and cost efficient computing environments. Cloud computing has and continues to become a integral part of modern technology. <br><br>


<strong>What is the likely impact? </strong><br>

Cloud computing continues to have an impact on the technology landscape, continuously changing the way businesses and individuals manage and utilize computing resources. It eliminates the need for companies to continue to have on site infrastructure.  The cloud also allows for seamless remote working environments as it provides centralised access to applications, data and resources. This will allow for businesses to shift from needing employees to come into a physical office to allowing remote workers located anywhere in the world to work on projects. <br><br>

In the coming years, traditional on site IT departments will start to become obsolete, with no need for companies to have a dedicated team managing the on site infrastructure as it will predominantly be cloud based (Solutions, 2022). Instead of managing an organisations hardware and software internally, companies will be able to outsource these tasks to cloud service providers making on site IT techs redundant. While Cloud Computing will take away some jobs in IT, it will also create new cloud based ones as all the cloud equipment will need to be replaced. <br><br>

Advancements in cloud computing will also replace a number of jobs due to the streamlined and seamless automation capabilities that it can provide. Self driving vehicles and drones will inevitably replace the taxi and delivery industries, while AI will replace financial planners and accountants making them redundant. <br><br> 
<strong>How will this affect you? </strong><br>

Cloud computing has already had a significant impact on my life. As someone that currently works in the IT field, my life currently involves utilizing cloud computing daily. Cloud computing enables me to access my own and my teams data and applications from anywhere in the world with an internet connection, meaning that both me and my team have the convenience of working remotely as we please. Sharing files with my clients is also very easy as all the data is already accessible through the internet and I only need to grant them access (there is no waiting for uploads). Cloud Computing also provides me with the convenience of an offsite and onsite backup which automatically sync with each other, reducing our risk of data loss. <br><br>

My family members have also been affected by cloud services at their work. My mum’s work has recently shifted to using cloud services to host their applications, giving them more flexibility on remote working, which allows my mum to travel to visit her parents and work from their house as she pleases! <br><br>

      In my opinion the Gravy Seals team worked great together throughout this assignment. We divided tasks among ourselves and checked in with each other often to ensure that we met our deadlines. Our team members were very cooperative, easy going and pleasant to work with. Our communication was good, allowing for everyone to express their ideas and provide feedback when necessary. During our meetings we had good discussions with each other and our diverse backgrounds and experiences helped with the success on completing this assignment. <br><br>

There were a few challenges along the way. As our team is scattered around Australia and we all have various work commitments we were not always able to meet as a team. We tried to find a time that everyone was available to meet but were not always successful. Despite this, we overcame this by ensuring that our meetings were recorded and requested that members who were not present make comments on the recordings at their earliest convenience.  The Gravy Seals team has been great to work with and I look forward to continuing to work with them on the next assignment. <br><br>
