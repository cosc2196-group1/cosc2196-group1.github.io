        <p>The Gravy Seals are a collection of students studying Introduction to IT. The group are from all over
          Australia with different interests and hobbies. This section will introduce the team.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Angus Dobson - s3814798</h4>
        <p>Angus was born and raised in Australia and speaks both English and Japanese. Angus has a passion for plants,
          owning several expensive and rare varieties with a recent acquisition of a Monstera Borsigiana Albo. From a
          young age, Angus found he had a strong interest in IT. He loved pulling apart computers and putting them back
          together to see how they worked. This then lead him down the path of teaching himself programming and creating
          websites, game mods and applications.</p>
        <p>After high school in 2015, Angus enrolled in on-campus studies at UQ. A short time after he was approached by
          his previous employer with a job offer in the managed service provider field. He started out answering phones
          in a customer service role, then as he got more competent, he moved into a level 2 technician role in which he
          became a point of contact for his fellow workmates. Angus now works at a new company in a similar role.</p>
        <p>Angus has participated in online tests such as Myers-Briggs, Online Learning Style and Big Five Personality
          with results as follows. </p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Myers-Briggs:</strong> Commander (ENTJ-A)</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Style Test:</strong> 20% Auditory, 50% Visual, 30% Tactile (Visual Learner)</li>
          <li><strong>BigFive Personality Test:</strong> 65% Conscientiousness, 46% Agreeableness, 83% Openness To
            Experience, 71% Extraversion, 50% Neuroticism</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reflecting on these results it indicates that I am organized, assertive, and outgoing individual with an open
          mind and an inclination for visual learning. My tendency to be thorough, combined with a moderate level of
          agreeableness and neuroticism, suggests I would be best suited to roles that require attention to detail,
          leadership, and the ability to manage stress effectively.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Keaton Neville – s3472678</h4>
        <p>Keaton is an Australian citizen who currently lives in Canada. He has a passion for music, with a key
          interest in Guitar. Additionally, Keaton loves writing code, which stems from his interest in IT that started
          early when he explored computers and began learning about writing software.</p>
        <p>Keaton has been working in the IT industry for 10 years, specialising in support roles and software developer
          roles.</p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Myers-Briggs test:</strong> Architect (INT-J)</li>
          <li><strong>Learning style assessment:</strong> Visual</li>
          <li><strong>Work style test:</strong> Organised, Sequential, Planned, Detail oriented</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reflecting on the above results, Keaton may prefer to work with team members who deliver their work over time
          instead of rushing at the last moment – placing a high value on organisation and planning in teams.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Nathan Plunkett – s4028499</h4>
        <p>Nathan grew up in country Victoria and moved to Melbourne's Eastern suburbs to finish high school. He has
          lived in numerous states going where the work took him. Nathan has a strong passion for health and fitness and
          adheres to a strict gym routine and meal plan. His interest in IT is to gain some fundamental knowledge in the
          field as all his work experience has been gained from construction and military where tech is used but not
          explained.</p>
        <p>Nathan’s experience in IT is on the other end of the experience. He has used advanced technological systems
          in his time in the military and construction but has never been in a role which is part of innovation and
          creation of the tech itself.</p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Myers-Briggs test:</strong> Commander (ENTJ-A)</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Style Assessment:</strong> Visual learner</li>
          <li><strong>Creativity test:</strong> Creativity score of 60.52, Average score is 62.73.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The implications of these tests suggest that Nathan is a rational thinker, efficient and strong willed with
          tendencies to be cold, ruthless and stubborn. He would prefer to have visual displays of information and video
          chats rather than reading text to learn. His creativity level is slightly below the average.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Nicholas Mamone – s3754759</h4>
        <p>Nicholas was born and raised in Sydney Australia and has family ties from Italy from which his grandparents
          migrated from 70 years ago. He loves travelling and has a passion for taking photos on his travels. He will
          also never turn down an invitation to have drinks with some mates. His interest in IT started in year 9 when
          he learnt to program robotics.</p>
        <p>In 2014 Nicholas started a digital agency business. This business builds websites and manages client online
          presence. The agency currently manages more than 50 clients.</p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Myers-Briggs:</strong> Consul (ESFJ-A)</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Style:</strong> 30% Auditory, 55% Visual, 15% Tactile</li>
          <li><strong>The Big Five Test:</strong> 67% Neuroticism, 83% Extraversion, 78% Openness to Experience, 80%
            Agreeableness, 83% Conscientiousness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The results suggest I am an extremely sociable, organized, and friendly individual who is open to new
          experiences. I learn best visually, with a secondary preference for auditory information. My high neuroticism
          suggests I can be sensitive to stress, and high agreeableness means I am likely to excel in collaborative
          environments.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Jayson Pye - s3819431</h4>
        <p>Jayson was born in Sydney Australia but currently lives in Tokyo, Japan. He has followed a few different
          career paths including becoming a Teacher, Tradesman, Police recruit, and now aiming toward an IT career. He
          speaks English and Japanese, though his Japanese writing is not as strong.</p>
        <p>Jayson has had a fascination with IT from a young age, starting with building his first computer at 12, he is
          now excited to put all his energy into this field.</p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Myers-Briggs:</strong> Logician (INTP-A)</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Style Test:</strong> 25% Auditory, 15% Visual, 65% Tactile (Tactile Learner)</li>
          <li><strong>BigFive Personality Test:</strong> 78% Conscientiousness, 71% Agreeableness, 67% Openness To
            Experience, 96% Extraversion, 63% Neuroticism</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reflecting on these results I am highly extroverted, conscientious, and fairly agreeable with a significant
          openness to new experiences. I learn best through hands-on experience, preferring tactile methods over
          auditory and visual ones.</p>

      <h1 id="analysis-ideal-jobs">Analysis of Ideal Jobs</h1>
      <hr class="col-3 col-md-2 mb-5">
      <p>This section compares the ideal jobs for each team member, identifying common elements and individual
        differences. The ideal jobs span from UX/UI Designing to Software Engineering, Investment Analysis, and IT
        Coordination.</p>
      <p>Angus aims to be a UX/UI Designer, Keaton aspires to be a Principal Software Engineer, Nathan envisions himself
        as an Investment Analyst/Portfolio Manager, Nicholas sees himself as an IT Coordinator and Jayson aims to be a
        Backend Developer. Each role demands a unique set of skills and experiences.</p>
      <p>Despite the differences, a common thread across all the roles is the requirement for extensive experience in
        their respective fields. These roles also require strong attention to detail, collaboration skills, and the
        ability to manage and optimize systems or processes.</p>
      <p>The differences lie primarily in the specific skills needed. For Angus, he needs UX/UI best practices and
        design skills. Keaton requires experience in building software systems. Nathan's role demands financial
        expertise and investment experience. Jayson needs to aim towards more Software Development experience. Nicholas,
        on the other hand, needs experience in managing IT assets and producing IT reports and documentation.</p>
      <p>The analysis shows that although the ideal jobs vary, they all require significant professional experience,
        attention to detail, and strong collaboration skills. The distinct set of skills each team member aspires to
        acquire highlights the broad nature of IT and related fields. Each role has its unique demand but collectively,
        they reflect the rich diversity of the IT industry.</p>

      <h4>GitHub configuration</h4>
      <p>For this project, we have created a GitHub organisation and have invited each member of the group to the

      <h4>Audit Trail Analysis</h4>
      <p>Most of our collaboration for this project happened inside a Word document, allowing us to contribute our own
        changes for each of our sections with ease. We opted to leave moving our content into our GitHub Page until the
        document was finalised – our GitHub contributions reflect this. We initialised the GitHub Page early in the
        project to ensure there were no setup issues with getting a Page hosted on an Organization GitHub account. Once
        our content was starting to take shape in our Word document, we created the initial template for the Page and
        started to fill in individual sections. With our diverse backgrounds and experiences, we were able to leverage
        our team members work experience to fix layout issues as we noticed them.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Backend Engineer</strong><br>
        <strong>Demand</strong>
      <p>
        It’s expected that the demand for backend engineers is growing based on the data from industry.gov.au, burning
        glass and labourmarketinsights.gov.au. Backend Engineers can also come under the umbrella of software engineers,
        where it has been mentioned that the number of roles are expected to grow by 27% by 2026 (Labour Market
        Insights, 2021) and they are also listed as strongly in demand in all states.
      </p>
      <strong>Required Skills</strong>
      <p>
        From the data based on burning glass the highest in demand IT skills are SQL, JAVA and JavaScript which are all
        useful skills that a backend engineer should have great knowledge of. Additionally, they generally need to have
        a bachelor or postgraduate degree in an IT field. They should be analytical and have a very high skill level
        (Labour Market Insights, 2023).
      </p>
      <strong>Reflection on industry data</strong>
      <p>
        As I researched this role, I can confidently say that I have increased my interest in heading toward this field
        of work. Seeing that I have already headed down an acceptable path in working towards this role and that the
        skills I have acquired and that I will continue to acquire are directly applicable to these roles I believe that
        if I keep moving forward it will
        be achievable. I am also relieved and confident after seeing that there is a heavy growth in this industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>UI/UX Developer</strong><br>

        demand for UI/UX Developers. It is expected to increase from 64,100 jobs in 2021 to 78,100 jobs in 2026. Over
        70% of workers in this field work full-time, indicating both the robust demand for the role and the viability of
        the job as the primary source of income.
      </p>
      <strong>Required Skills</strong>
      <p>
        The average age of a UI/UX Developer is 35, and over 85% hold a degree in related fields. Essential general
        skills include problem-solving, active listening, and critical thinking. Key IT-specific skills involve
        proficiency in design software like Sketch and Figma, as well as languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        (Labour Market Insights, 2023).
      </p>
      <strong>Reflection on industry data</strong>
      <p>
        Exploring the industry data has solidified interest in the UI/UX Developer role. The significant growth
        prospects, coupled with the prevalence of full-time positions, make it an appealing career path. Moreover, the
        blend of technical and interpersonal skills matches my capabilities and interests. Seeing that the average age
        of professionals in this field is 35 makes this an achievable mid-term career goal. This research has further
        ignited my enthusiasm for a career in UI/UX development.
      </p>

      <strong>IT Coordinator</strong><br>
      <strong>Demand</strong>
      <p>
        As per the data gathered from industry.gov.au, labourmarketinsights.gov.au, and Burning Glass, the demand for IT
        Coordinators is steadily increasing, with an expected growth from 36,300 jobs in 2021 to 44,000 jobs in 2026.
        Additionally, 86% of the workers in this role work full-time, which suggests a strong job market and enough
        working hours for it to serve as a primary income source.
      </p>
      <strong>Required Skills</strong>
      <p>
        The average age for IT Coordinators is 38, and over 88% of workers hold at least a degree. Key general skills
        include problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and project management. IT-specific skills consist of
        proficiency in software like MS Office, knowledge of networking and cloud platforms, and a good understanding of
        ITIL framework (Labour Market Insights 2023).
      </p>
      <strong>Reflection on industry data</strong>
      <p>
        The robust demand for IT Coordinators and the preponderance of full-time positions reinforce interest in this
        career path. The job's technical and interpersonal skill requirements align with my skills and interests. The
        information that the average age of professionals in this field is 38 sets a feasible career goal timeline. This

      <h4>Job 3 – Software Engineer</h4>
      <p>As uncovered in the industry insights section of this report, the role of a Software Engineer is incredibly
        varied depending on the company they work for, the industry they’re in and what type of software development
        they do. Typically, a Software Engineer works as an individual contributor, taking on multiple tasks they have
        either been assigned by their manager or through a central project management and collaboration software tool
        such as Jira or Trello. The types of tasks a developer might do include implementing feature requests,
        investigating and solving bugs in software, writing documentation, and designing and architecting new software
        systems.</p>
      <p>While Software Engineers and Developers are the individuals writing code and implementing features and bug
        fixes, taking a software project from ideation to the end user is not single handedly performed by developers,
        with interactions by UI / UX Designers, Product Managers and Project Managers all common. The most common type
        of challenge experienced by people working as software developers is solving complex bugs that are hard to
        reproduce, or when a project is taking longer to complete than expected and having to spend some time working
        later than expected to meet the deadline. In some of the videos reviewed, interviewing candidates was often
        referenced in their day-to-day activities, affirming that there is a lot of demand from employers to hire people
        into these roles.</p>

      <h1 id="emerging-it-technologies">Emerging IT Technologies</h1>
      <hr class="col-3 col-md-2 mb-5">
      <p>In this section we explore some new and emerging IT technologies. We have chosen blockchain and
        cryptocurrencies, clouds, services and servers, cybersecurity and natural language processing and chatterbots.
      </p>
      <hr class="col-3 col-md-2 mb-5">

      <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
      <p>When computers were first invented in the mid-1900s cyber-crime began to become popular almost immediately.
        However, the history of cybersecurity dates back even further. In 1934, a financial market attack in France
        targeted the telegraph system, showing the early beginnings of cyber threats (Arctic Wolf, 2022).</p>
      <p>As cybercrimes were escalating, the need for robust defence mechanisms became obvious. In the 1970s, Ray
        Tomlinson the inventor of email, developed an innovative solution to fight against tracing worms known as
        “Creepers.” He created a program called “Reaper”, which hunted down and destroyed Creepers (Davies, 2021). Since
        then, cybersecurity measures have evolved in tandem with emerging cyber-attack methods and technologies in a
        constant race to keep up.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the world has experienced a significant shift in the way we work due to the pandemic caused by
        COVID-19. The need to adapt to remote work arrangements has really opened up new opportunities for cyber-attacks
        targeting this type of work. With an estimated 48% of knowledge workers expected to be working in either hybrid
        or fully remote settings by 2023 (McLellan, 2023) the chance of cyber-attacks will only continue to grow. This
        reality pushes the envelope with the need to stay up to date with the latest technologies to prevent and/or
        mitigate these threats effectively.</p>
      <p>As we look towards a future where we could potentially have new attacks prevented before they are developed,
        the integration of AI and machine learning technologies have shown to be a real game-changer in cybersecurity.
        By leveraging these technologies, companies can analyse a vast amount of data to identify trends, patterns and
        abnormalities that could indicate a cyber threat. AI and machine learning have the ability to process and
        interpret data in real-time, enabling us to detect cyber-attacks proactively and prevent them.</p>
      <p>One notable technology in this field is IBM’s QRadar. Although it has been available since 2022, this
        technology is rapidly advancing due to the continuous development of AI. The system can collect, process and
        store network data in real time, which allows companies to manage their network security more efficiently. By
        providing real-time information and alerts about possible network threats, QRadar can enable companies and
        organizations to respond promptly and effectively (IBM, 2023).</p>
      <p>The current state of AI and machine learning with regards to cybersecurity shows a real leap forward in threat
        detection and response. These technologies are able to detect known as well as unknown threats, which helps
        adapt to different emerging attacks and continuously learn new data. In the next three years, as we have seen
        new AI take leaps forward in recent years with the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 (Dheda, 2023). We
        could also be seeing leaps forward in these technologies alongside it, the field is definitely an exciting one
        with constant advancements being made. Additionally, along with increases in AI we are seeing computing power
        grow and grow, which also increases the availability to scale datasets and analyse even more data. These things
        will increase the learning potential of AI and help it to identify and counter new cyber threats earlier and
        earlier.</p>
      <p>Cybersecurity being integrated with AI and machine learning can be viewed as ready to have a real
        transformative impact. From automating threat detections and responses, we can use these technologies to
        increase the accuracy of cybersecurity operations as well as increase the availability of high-quality
        cybersecurity services to companies. As of now companies can expect to spend quite a large budget on their
        cybersecurity departments with Facebook admittedly having spent $13 billion on “safety and security” since 2016,
        and having 40,000 staff dedicated to the field (Robertson, 2021). If we are able to get to a point where AI is
        able to automatically deal with threats as well as heighten overall protection against new threats, we can
        expect to see a significant drop in these numbers and an increase in availability to companies that might
        otherwise be running with a low budget for this field. Additionally, with a widespread implementation of these
        technologies it would create new roles and increase demand for skilled professionals who are able to optimize
        the use of these technologies.</p>

      <h4>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h4>
      <p>The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was created by either a programmer or a group of programmers using
        the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of the creator of Bitcoin is still to this day unknown (Pinkerton 2023).
      </p>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency which can’t be materialised and uses decentralised control. This means
        that transactions are strictly between the parties involved, there are no intermediaries facilitating the
        transactions such as banks like the normal monetary system and parties remain completely anonymous. This allows
        users to buy and sell things with little to no fees and is the main reason why interest in crypto is growing
        every year (Hassani et al. 2018).</p>
      <p>For these transactions to function and maintain security, a blockchain is used. A blockchain is basically a
        digital storage of transactions. These transactions are replicated and sent to a network of nodes to record all
        the information, verify it, and then create a block which is added to the chain. A block in a blockchain stores
        a certain number of transactions, then another block is created and distributed to all participants in the node
        network (Duggan 2022). Each transaction must be verified through digital signatures from each party involved in
        the transaction. These signatures are in the form of private and public keys. The keys are unique identifiers
        for each party which acts like a password and once each party has entered their keys the transaction is sent to
        all verification nodes. These nodes are operated by people that have been incentivised to verify transactions
        with the potential for rewards, they are known as crypto miners (Duggan 2022).</p>
      <p>The spike in crypto popularity has given rise to new lending, borrowing and trading opportunities known as
        DeFi. DeFi or decentralized finance offers financial services much like banks but in the form of cryptocurrency.
        This is becoming more popular because it often reduces the fees and commissions you would otherwise pay if you
        went through a bank (Siripurapu and Berman 2023).</p>
      <p>Some impacts of the rise of crypto are that it has created a platform for criminal activity such as ransomware
        attacks, which involve shutting down networks and demanding payment to restore them and drug cartels laundering
        money through virtual currencies, utilising the anonymous nature of the transactions. The reaction to these
        activities by the US government is to monitor the transactions of crypto back to the US dollar (Siripurapu and
        Berman 2023).</p>

      <h4>Natural Language Processing & Chatterbots</h4>
      <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that primarily encompasses software
        that enables computers to understand text and speech like the way humans do (IBM, n.d.). While NLP is a subset
        of Artificial Intelligence, the applications for Natural Language Processing are almost infinite – with any task
        involving the parsing of

        text or speech by a human and then acting on that information having the potential to be completed by using
        Natural Language processing techniques. As Natural Language Processing is a wide and complex field, this report
        will be focusing on text-based NLP.</p>
      <p>Natural Language Processing has roots in linguistics, with the understanding of context and nuances of language
        being the focus. Early uses of NLP were rule based, with systems and solutions fitted to specific applications.
        One of the earliest rule-based approaches to NLP was IBM’s Georgetown experiment, where a typist entered phrases
        in Russian into a computer and had the computer translate these back in English. (IBM, 1954).</p>
      <p>As rule-based translation requires significant work by hand to understand language and craft rulesets, advances
        in computing technology unlocked newer methods of translation, particularly with Statistical Machine Translation
        (SMT). SMT shifted from relying on hand crafted rulesets to leveraging large texts and statistical models to
        generate probability based translations. IBM’s Candide system for translating French to English is one example
        of applying statistical methods to translate from one language to another. The model for Candide is comprised of
        ingesting English and French sentence pairs from the Canadian Hansard, an English-French record of the Canadian
        Parliament (Berger, et al. 1994).</p>
      <p>While statistical machine translation performs well when there is corpus available for the language pairs, it
        only works for specific pairs of languages such as the above example with English and French while less common
        language pairs have less reference data available, making statistical models hard to generate. Fortunately,
        further developments in Artificial Intelligence and particularly the development of the Transformer architecture
        for neural networks have had a major impact on the field of Natural Language Processing. The Transformer
        architecture is multiple layers of neural network mechanisms and components that work together to process an
        input and allow the model to contextualise the input it has received, allowing it to further recognize patterns
        and relationships in data. (Kulshresthra, 2020).</p>
      <p>Recently, developments in Natural Language Processing leveraging the Transformer architecture have been made
        available to the public with immediate impact. OpenAI’s GPT-3 (Generative Pre Trained Transformer 3) is a
        Large-Language-Model that has been trained on extensive and diverse datasets that amass to around 45TB of data
        and 175 billion parameters (Cooper, 2021). This has resulted in a chat-based product, Chat GPT - that is able to
        understand and generate text like a human would. A user of Chat GPT can provide the software with prompts
        containing contextual information, reference data or direction on what the user wants Chat GPT to do. It can,
        for example, take in a large text reference and summarise it for a user. It can also generate code in multiple
        programming languages. The implications of this technology are widespread, transformative, and potentially,
        completely unknown. (Mollick, 2022).</p>
      <p>Almost immediately, the impacts of releasing Chat GPT to the public were causing both tremendous excitement and
        concern for the future. The Education sector was one of the first industries to be affected by this emerging
        technology with schools having to rapidly learn both how their students were using this technology and how they
        can shape learning in the future to be enhanced by it (Roose, 2023). Professionals have also found success with
        using Chat GPT to automate their day-to-day tasks such as analysing data, responding to emails and creating
        content for their work.</p>
      <p>With all the success of time and effort saved by automating day-to-day tasks, the negatives of this emerging
        technology are starting to become visible with the fear of jobs being replaced by AI becoming a closer threat.
        IBM recently paused hiring in back-office type roles such as human resources as they expect with the
        improvements to the technology over time, AI could replace over 7000 employees (Edwards, 2023). As more people
        are aware of the potential dangers of more widespread AI adoption, criticism over who should be allowed to
        develop and control these models has become a hot topic recently. The European Union has recently called for
        regulation, with their AI Act aiming to ensure safety and transparency in artificial intelligence technical, and
        to prevent harmful outcomes ensuring that systems are overseen by humans (European Parliament, 2023).</p>
      <p>Personally, I have used Chat GPT to look for a bug in code that I’ve written or explain why a unit test isn’t
        working and provide suggestions on how to fix it - this has saved me countless hours of frustration, enabling me
        to be more efficient in my day-to-day work. I also see a lot of opportunities for this technology to enhance the
        working lives of many people close to me - my partner who spends a lot of their time as a lawyer reviewing
        documents and case files could use this technology to summarise these documents for them, providing an improved
        work life balance. I have witnessed new folks in the software development industry using Chat GPT as a pair
        programmer to help them understand new languages and frameworks quicker.</p>

      <h4>Clouds, Services, Servers</h4>
      <p>Cloud computing has revolutionised the way businesses and individuals manage and process their data. Cloud
        computing has paved the way for scalable, efficient, flexible and cost effective enterprise computing
        environments (Thecodest, 2023). The technology has and continues to rapidly develop over the years, offering a
        plethora of services and enabling more computing possibilities. At their core, clouds are large, interconnected
        servers that are accessible through the internet (Cloudflare, 2023). They allow users

        to access a shared pool of resources. Clouds provide on-demand access to resources, eliminating the need for
        local infrastructure and reducing setup costs dramatically. Cloud computing offers scalability which allows
        businesses to expand their computing resources on demand.</p>
      <p>There are a range of different offerings that are available from cloud computing, including Infrastructure as a
        Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtual computing
        resources which allow users to provision and manage virtual machines, storage servers and networks. PaaS allows
        developers to build, test and deploy applications in a scalable environment. SaaS houses ready to use software
        that can easily be setup and deployed (Watts &amp; Raza, 2019).</p>
      <p>There are a number of large scale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google
        Cloud Platform who each have infrastructure and data centres located around the globe. Between all these
        providers, they offer a variety of services from storage and virtual machines to advanced analytics and
        artificial intelligence capabilities.</p>
      <p>Today, cloud computing allows organisations to leverage data analytics, machine learning and artificial
        intelligence to gain insights on their products. The benefits of doing this on the cloud means that businesses
        can process large volumes of data quickly, which allows them to be more productive. The cloud also allows for
        seamless collaboration with teams allowing for remote teams to work and access shared resources from anywhere in
        the world with an internet connection.</p>
      <p>Over the next couple of years, there are several advancements in cloud computing that are expected to
        revolutionise it. Cloud computing providers are expected to increase their scalability even more, allowing
        businesses to seamlessly scale their computing resources on demand.</p>
      <p>Cloud based Advance AI and Machine Learning services will become even more sophisticated and faster, allowing
        organisations to leverage powerful algorithms and predictive insights (7MA, 2021). This will help in various
        sectors including medicine, autonomous vehicles and automation. As technology like Quantum computing develops,
        cloud providers will be sure to integrate its capabilities into their services.</p>
      <p>Over the next few years, we will see more organisations starting to adopt a hybrid cloud model, where they are
        able to utilise the benefits of cloud computing whilst also having their important data stored locally for
        quicker access.</p>
      <p>Cloud computing will also play a vital role in promoting sustainability as providers continue to invest in
        energy efficient infrastructure, renewable energy sources and carbon offset initiatives to minimize their
        environmental impact (Beardmore, 2022). By also enabling organisations to allow remote work, they also reduce
        the environmental impacts from needing to commute.</p>
      <p>Cloud computing has transformed the way in which businesses and individuals handle their data, offering on
        demand scalability, flexible and cost efficient computing environments. Cloud computing has and continues to
        become an integral part of modern technology.</p>
      <p>Cloud computing continues to have an impact on the technology landscape, continuously changing the way
        businesses and individuals manage and utilize computing resources. It eliminates the need for companies to
        continue to have on site infrastructure. The cloud also allows for seamless remote working environments as it
        provides centralized access to applications, data and resources. This will allow for businesses to shift from
        needing employees to come into a physical office to allowing remote workers located anywhere in the world to
        work on projects.</p>
      <p>In the coming years, traditional on site IT departments will start to become obsolete, with no need for
        companies to have a dedicated team managing the on site infrastructure as it will predominantly be cloud based
        (Solutions, 2022). Instead of managing an organisations hardware and software internally, companies will be able
        to outsource these tasks to cloud service providers making on site IT techs redundant. While Cloud Computing
        will take away some jobs in IT, it will also create new cloud based ones as all the cloud equipment will need to
        be replaced.</p>
      <p>Advancements in cloud computing will also replace a number of jobs due to the streamlined and seamless
        automation capabilities that it can provide. Self driving vehicles and drones will inevitably replace the taxi
        and delivery industries, while AI will replace financial planners and accountants making them redundant.</p>
      <p>Cloud computing has already had a significant impact on my life. As someone that currently works in the IT
        field, my life currently involves utilizing cloud computing daily. Cloud computing enables me to access my own
        and my teams data and applications from anywhere in the world with an internet connection, meaning that both me
        and my team have the convenience of working remotely as we please. Sharing files with my clients is also very
        easy as all the data is already accessible through the internet and I only need to grant them access (there is
        no waiting for uploads). Cloud Computing also provides me with the convenience of an offsite and onsite backup
        which automatically sync with each other, reducing our risk of data loss.</p>
      <p>My family members have also been affected by cloud services at their work. My mum’s work has recently shifted
        to using cloud services to host their applications, giving them more flexibility on remote working, which allows
        my mum to travel to visit her parents and work from their house as she pleases!</p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        In modern times, technology has been integrated into virtually every aspect of life, including meal planning and
        grocery shopping. Through the development of innovative applications, meal planning and shopping have been
        streamlined to meet the needs of the fast-paced lifestyle that characterizes modern society. The project idea
        proposed, Dinnerizer, seeks to enhance this experience by incorporating novel features into a meal planning
        application, providing a comprehensive solution to meal planning and grocery shopping.
      </p>

      <h4>Overview of the Project</h4>
      <p>
        "Dinnerizer" is a dynamic meal planning solution designed for both desktop and mobile platforms. The application
        presents a wide variety of dinner options tailored to the user's preferences, dietary restrictions, desired
        cuisine styles, and specific ingredients to aid in reducing food waste. Dinnerizer not only generates
        comprehensive recipes but also compiles an organized shopping list for user convenience. The overarching aim is
        to ease daily dinner decision-making, promote diversity in meals, minimize waste, and enhance the overall
        cooking experience for a broad range of users, including those with disabilities.
      </p>

      <h4>Motivation and Objectives</h4>
      <p>
        Dinnerizer stems from the common, everyday challenge of deciding what to cook. This daily issue often leads
        to repetitive meals, unhealthy takeaway options, and food wastage. By providing varied meal suggestions and a
        meticulously compiled shopping list, Dinnerizer promotes home cooking and healthier dietary habits. The main
        objective is to create a valuable tool that improves lifestyle by making the process of meal planning more
        efficient, enjoyable, and accessible for all users, irrespective of their dietary preferences or physical
        abilities.
      </p>

      <h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>
        Dinnerizer is a comprehensive application with an extensive recipe database managed using SQLite for improved
        scalability and search functionality. The user experience is tailored for simplicity, with a keen focus on
        accessibility, accommodating users with visual impairments or other disabilities. The application implements a
        feature to include specific ingredients in the meal recommendations, aiming to help users reduce waste. With a
        continuous feedback loop with users, the application will be iteratively improved based on users' needs and
        suggestions, making it a truly user-centric solution.
      </p>

      <h4>Tools and Technologies Used</h4>
      <p>
        The Dinnerizer project will utilize a range of tools and technologies to create a robust, user-friendly
        application compatible with both desktop and mobile platforms. The core of the application will be developed in
        Java due to its extensive libraries, excellent security features, and its inherent cross-platform capabilities,
        making it ideal for building an application that needs to function seamlessly across various platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the graphical user interface, we plan to use JavaFX, known for its versatility and the richness of its
        controls, which will enable us to design an intuitive and visually appealing interface. Our aim is to make
        Dinnerizer a pleasing experience for users, both functionally and aesthetically.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important aspect of the Dinnerizer application is data management, for which we will utilize SQLite. SQLite
        is a lightweight database solution known for its efficiency and portability, making it an ideal choice for an
        application that needs to function well on mobile devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mobile component of Dinnerizer will be handled using the cross-platform capabilities of Java combined with
        mobile-specific libraries and frameworks. For Android, we will use Android Studio, Google's official IDE for
        Android development, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for building apps on every type of Android
        device. For iOS, we will explore the use of multi-platform frameworks such as React Native or Flutter, both
        renowned for their ability to create native-like mobile applications using a single codebase.
      </p>

      <h4>Skills Required</h4>
      <p>
        The development of Dinnerizer requires a team skilled in Java programming and experienced with JavaFX for GUI
        design. Knowledge of SQLite for efficient data management is essential. The team should also possess a sound
        understanding of user interface design principles, including accessibility features. The ability to conduct user
        research and usability testing, respond to feedback, and iteratively improve the application will be crucial to
        its successful development and user reception.
      </p>

      <h4>Projected Outcomes</h4>
      <p>
        Upon completion, Dinnerizer will serve as a valuable tool that simplifies meal planning and offers a structured
        approach to grocery shopping. By alleviating decision fatigue, Dinnerizer will facilitate a diverse range of
        meals, promoting healthier home-cooked diets. Efficient grocery shopping could also mean less waste and
        cost-saving. As a future-oriented application, it will include plans for user feedback, potential monetisation
        considerations, and marketing plans to ensure that the application is continuously improved and relevant to its
        users.
      </p>

      <h4>Innovation and Uniqueness</h4>
      <p>
        The Dinnerizer application is set apart by its commitment to reducing waste by suggesting meals based on
        specific ingredients and promoting varied and diverse meals. Its dedication to accessibility ensures its
        usability across a wide demographic, including visually impaired and physically disabled individuals. The
        inclusion of a continuous feedback loop and the use of lightweight databases for improved scalability and search
        functionality adds a layer of innovation to this project. Dinnerizer goes beyond a conventional meal planning
        application by offering a comprehensive solution tailored to the user's preferences, dietary restrictions,
        desired
        cuisine styles, and specific ingredients.
      </p>

      <h4>Feasibility and Market Needs</h4>
      <p>
        As of the current technology landscape, Dinnerizer is a feasible project that aligns well with the digital
        trends
        in the food and lifestyle sector. Given the increased awareness about sustainable living and healthy eating, the
        market demand for such an application is high. Moreover, the tools and technologies needed for the project are
        widely available, and the skills required align with standard software development skill sets.
      </p>

      <h4>Feedback Incorporation and Detailed Mechanics</h4>
      <p>
        The idea of Dinnerizer came about from one of the group members' ideas and the feedback received from our
        Assignment. The suggestion to make it more inclusive and accessible came directly from feedback as it emphasized
        the importance of software accessibility in today's world. This led us to consider including features that make
        our application usable by individuals with disabilities. Based on the feedback received, we have planned to
        include a feature that lets users include specific ingredients in their meal recommendations to help reduce food
        waste.
      </p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        The Dinnerizer project aspires to bring about a revolution in the field of meal planning and grocery shopping.
        With
        its focus on accessibility, diversity in meals, reduction in food waste, and comprehensive shopping lists, it is
        more than just a meal planning app. It's a tool designed to enhance lifestyle, promote healthier habits, and
        bring
        joy back to home cooking. The development of this application will contribute to the tech industry by addressing
        a
        common problem with a holistic solution that puts users and their needs at the forefront.

      <h1 id="group-reflection">Group Reflection</h1>
      <hr class="col-3 col-md-2 mb-5">
      <h4>Angus:</h4>
      <p>
        Looking back on our group work, there is a sense of accomplishment that arises from the collective effort we
        exhibited. What stood out remarkably was our speedy group formation and the initial meeting that followed. This
        decisiveness laid the foundation for equal contribution from all members, a pattern that remained consistent
        throughout our collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the journey was not without its potential areas for improvement. One aspect that could be better is
        refining our time management strategies. Although our project progressed well, there were instances where we
        could have been more efficient with our scheduling as people were located across Australia and across the world
        at one point.
      </p>
      <p>
        A surprising element during our journey was the way in which differing opinions were not only allowed but
        encouraged. This, I believe, enriched our group discussions, and led to comprehensive and well-rounded outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this process, I've learned that good group dynamics can significantly influence the quality of work.
        Understanding how to navigate differences, delegate tasks effectively, and create a supportive environment are
        critical skills for any group endeavor.
      </p>

      <h4>Nicholas:</h4>
      <p>
        In my opinion the Gravy Seals team worked great together throughout this assignment. We divided tasks among
        ourselves and checked in with each other often to ensure that we met our deadlines. Our team members were very
        cooperative, easy going and pleasant to work with. Our communication was good, allowing for everyone to express
        their ideas and provide feedback when necessary. During our meetings we had good discussions with each other and
        our diverse backgrounds and experiences helped with the success on completing this assignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were a few challenges along the way. As our team is scattered around Australia and we all have various
        work commitments we were not always able to meet as a team. We tried to find a time that everyone was available
        to meet but were not always successful. Despite this, we overcame this by ensuring that our meetings were
        recorded and requested that members who were not present make comments on the recordings at their earliest
        convenience. The Gravy Seals team has been great to work with and I look forward to continuing to work with them
        on the next assignment.
      </p>

      <h4>Nathan:</h4>
      <p>
        The group started off a little slow which was expected with an online group as we had to try and figure out the
        best time to meet up for our weekly meetings. We intentionally allocated a small amount of work for the first
        week just while we figured out a good meeting plan. By the time the second meeting happened though the gravy
        seals were in full swing. We divided large segments of the report between the group members and set the one-week
        deadline. From this point on the group worked like a well-greased machine with members not only finishing their
        tasks but also going out of their way to start the next task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our meetings were short, but they got straight to the point as we had discussions leading into meetings
        addressing what we were going to talk about. I enjoy our meetings as it creates a more friendly environment
        where we have had a few laughs rather than just relying on texting back and forth which can be quite boring. I
        am overall happy that our team got together and am excited to see how our team project will evolve leading into
        assignment 3.
      </p>

      <h4>Keaton:</h4>
      <p>
        I felt that our group the Gravy Seals has worked well together – coordinating times between 5 people across
        Australia is no easy feat with different time zones, schedules and lifestyles all playing a part. We had a great
        mix of both synchronous engagement and asynchronous engagement – allowing everyone to participate in whichever
        way they felt the most comfortable. Surprisingly, each team member showed initiative and was able to carry a
        portion of the project on their own without being directed, which is a breath of fresh air compared to some past
        experiences in group projects. While we all have different schedules, we’re all invested in making our deadline.
      </p>

      <h4>Jayson:</h4>
      <p>
        In my opinion this group was very organised with strong leadership by Angus and strong daily updates by Keaton
        when leading up to the submission which helped all people stay on track. All the large sections were split up in
        order to assign a fair workload to each member of the team. It was also great that meetings were kept short and
        concise so that if a meeting was missed by a member, they could look at the recording and obtain all the
        important information clearly and easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were set with challenges as any group should be, particularly being time zone issues and late work shifts, to
        which I am an offender. However, with strong leadership and positive attitudes we managed to stay on track and
        stay as communicative as possible given the circumstances.
      </p>

      <h4>Collective Reflection:</h4>
      <p>
        Overall, the Gravy Seals team had a successful working experience throughout the assignment. The team formed
        quickly, and self-organised to schedule meetings to start the project. The team found working together to be a
        positive experience, with members reflecting that each team member contributed fairly and were able to not only
        complete their assigned tasks, but also ensure the project was moving forward. The team checked in regularly
        asynchronously on Teams and met twice a week. Our effective communication allowed us to meet our deadline and
        foster a cooperative working environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, it was a slower start as we navigated scheduling an initial meeting that worked for everyone's
        schedule. However, we were able to make a start on our project by filling in various sections from Assessment 1
        whilst we waited to meet. Once we established our meeting schedule and started allocating our work, the team was
        able to complete individual tasks assigned and show imitative to ensure the project was progressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        One surprising aspect of our collaboration was the individual initiative demonstrated by our team members. We
        have all had past experiences of group projects where only one or two members are pulling all the weight, but in
        this project, everyone had an equal share and were bought into the success of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lessons learned from this project include the importance of communication, especially when everyone is on a
        different schedule and has their own life commitments outside of schooling. We also learned that people work
        effectively in different ways and allowing each team member the space to work in the way that best suited them
        paid off for our team.
