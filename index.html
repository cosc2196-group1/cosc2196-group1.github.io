      <p><strong>Nathan Plunkett – s4028499 </strong><br>

        Nathan grew up in country Victoria and moved to Melbourne's Eastern suburbs to finish high school. He has lived in numerous states going where the work took him. 
        Nathan has a strong passion for health and fitness and adheres to a strict gym routine and meal plan. His interest in IT is to gain some fundamental knowledge in 
        the field as all his work experience has been gained from construction and military where tech is used but not explained. <br><br>

        Nathan’s experience in IT is on the other end of the experience. He has used advanced technological systems in his time in the military and construction but has 
        never been in a role which is part of innovation and creation of the tech itself. <br><br>

        Nathan has participated in online tests such as Myers-Briggs, Learning Style Assessment and Creativity Test with results as follows. <br><br>

        <strong>Myers-Briggs: </strong><br>

      <strong>Investment analyst/portfolio manager</strong><br>
      <strong>Demand:</strong><br>
      The demand in job roles like this are expected to grow in the next 3 years with growth projected to be from 62,100 jobs in 2021 to 68,800 
      jobs in 2026 (labour market insights, 2021). Labour market insights (2021) also show that 84% of the workers in these roles are working 
      full-time hours. This suggests that not only is the demand for the job in good shape but also the number of hours involved in the job will 
      be sufficient for it to be the sole income. <br><br>

      <strong>Required skills:</strong><br>
      The average age for people working in roles like these is 42 and over 80% of people working in the field hold at least a diploma. 
      Some of the most sort after skills for these roles are reading comprehension, speaking, active listening and critical thinking 
      (Labour Market Insights 2021). Some of the IT crossover skills required by these roles include but are not limited to, communication using 
      media, telecommunications, and utilising electronics to record and document data (Labour Market Insights 2021). <br><br>

      <strong>Reflection based on industry data:</strong><br>
      After researching the job role in more detail, I can say that my interest in the job role has not changed. The growth indicated in the report 
      and the large number of hours offered by such roles gives me the confidence to pursue this type of role as a career path. The average age of 
      workers being 42 also helps with my goals as I can set myself a 10-year career goal to achieve this type of role. <br><br>

      A day in the life of a cyber security analyst starts a lot like most jobs, checking emails for any priority tasks. Morning meetings are incorporated 
      into the day to day to collaborate with the team and see how everyone is traveling with their tasks. The types of projects a cybersecurity analyst 
      will work on varies, some may answer calls from existing clients and investigate problems/implement fixes. Other jobs can be working on benchmark 
      security protocols specific to a project or client and make them available online. Throughout the day analysts will check the Endpoint Detection & 
      Response (EDR) which monitors the traffic on the network for any malicious activity. As an analyst continues to improve their skills, they can advance 
      in their career to start working on firewalls and switching and routing. This is usually configuring the firewalls, switches and routers and optimising 
      their effectiveness (Day In The Life Of A Cyber Security Analyst. It's Probably Not What You Thought, Or Is It..... - YouTube ;

      <Strong>Clouds, Services, Servers</Strong><br>

      <Strong>What does it do? </Strong><br>

      Cloud computing has revolutionised the way businesses and individuals manage and process their data. Cloud
      computing has paved the way for scalable, efficient, flexible and cost effective enterprise computing environments
      (Thecodest, 2023). The technology has and continues to rapidly develop over the years, offering a plethora of
      services and enabling more computing possibilities. At their core, clouds are large, interconnected servers that
      are accessible through the internet (Cloudflare, 2023). They allow users to access a shared pool of resources.
      Clouds provide on-demand access to resources, eliminating the need for local infrastructure and reducing setup
      costs dramatically. Cloud computing offers scalability which allows businesses to expand their computing resources
      on demand as needed.<br><br>

      There are a range of different offerings that are available from cloud computing, including Infrastructure as a
      Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtual computing
      resources which allow users to provision and manage virtual machines, storage servers and networks. PaaS allows
      developers to build, test and deploy applications in a scalable environment. SaaS houses ready to use software
      that can easily be setup and deployed (Watts & Raza, 2019). <br><br>

      There are a number of large scale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google
      Cloud Platform who each have infrastructure and data centres located around the globe. Between all these
      providers, they offer a variety of services from storage and virtual machines to advanced analytics and artificial
      intelligence capabilities. <br><br>

      Today, cloud computing allows organisations to leverage data analytics, machine learning and artificial
      intelligence to gain insights on their products. The benefits of doing this on the cloud means that businesses can
      process large volumes of data quickly, which allows them to be more productive. The cloud also allows for seamless
      collaboration with teams allowing for remote teams to work and access shared resources from anywhere in the world
      with an internet connection. <br><br>

      Over the next couple of years, there are several advancements in cloud computing that are expected to
      revolutionise it. Cloud computing providers are expected to increase their scalability even more, allowing
      businesses to seamlessly scale their computing resources on demand. <br><br>

      Cloud based Advance AI and Machine Learning services will become even more sophisticated and faster, allowing
      organisations to leverage powerful algorithms and predictive insights (7MA, 2021). This will help in various
      sectors including medicine, autonomous vehicles and automation. As technology like Quantum computing develops,
      cloud providers will be sure to integrate its capabilities into their services. <br><br>

      Over the next few years, we will see more organisations starting to adopt a hybrid cloud model, where they are
      able to utilise the benefits of cloud computing whilst also having their important data stored locally for quicker
      access. <br><br>

      Cloud computing will also play a vital role in promoting sustainability as providers continue to invest in energy
      efficient infrastructure, renewable energy sources and carbon offset initiatives to minimize their environmental
      impact (Beardmore, 2022). By also enabling organisations to allow remote work, they also reduce the environmental
      impacts from needing to commute. <br><br>

      Cloud computing has transformed the way in which businesses and individuals handle their data, offering on demand
      scalability, flexible and cost efficient computing environments. Cloud computing has and continues to become a
      integral part of modern technology. <br><br>


      <strong>What is the likely impact? </strong><br>

      Cloud computing continues to have an impact on the technology landscape, continuously changing the way businesses
      and individuals manage and utilize computing resources. It eliminates the need for companies to continue to have
      on site infrastructure. The cloud also allows for seamless remote working environments as it provides centralised
      access to applications, data and resources. This will allow for businesses to shift from needing employees to come
      into a physical office to allowing remote workers located anywhere in the world to work on projects. <br><br>

      In the coming years, traditional on site IT departments will start to become obsolete, with no need for companies
      to have a dedicated team managing the on site infrastructure as it will predominantly be cloud based (Solutions,
      2022). Instead of managing an organisations hardware and software internally, companies will be able to outsource
      these tasks to cloud service providers making on site IT techs redundant. While Cloud Computing will take away
      some jobs in IT, it will also create new cloud based ones as all the cloud equipment will need to be replaced.
      <br><br>

      Advancements in cloud computing will also replace a number of jobs due to the streamlined and seamless automation
      capabilities that it can provide. Self driving vehicles and drones will inevitably replace the taxi and delivery
      industries, while AI will replace financial planners and accountants making them redundant. <br><br> 
      <strong>How will this affect you? </strong><br>

      Cloud computing has already had a significant impact on my life. As someone that currently works in the IT field,
      my life currently involves utilizing cloud computing daily. Cloud computing enables me to access my own and my
      teams data and applications from anywhere in the world with an internet connection, meaning that both me and my
      team have the convenience of working remotely as we please. Sharing files with my clients is also very easy as all
      the data is already accessible through the internet and I only need to grant them access (there is no waiting for
      uploads). Cloud Computing also provides me with the convenience of an offsite and onsite backup which
      automatically sync with each other, reducing our risk of data loss. <br><br>

      My family members have also been affected by cloud services at their work. My mum’s work has recently shifted to
      using cloud services to host their applications, giving them more flexibility on remote working, which allows my
      mum to travel to visit her parents and work from their house as she pleases! <br><br>

      <Strong>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</Strong><br>

      <Strong>What does it do? </Strong><br>

      The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was created by either a programmer or a group of programmers using the
      name Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of the creator of Bitcoin is still to this day unknown (Pinkerton 2023). 
      Cryptocurrency is a digital currency which can’t be materialised and uses decentralised control. This means that 
      transactions are strictly between the parties involved, there are no intermediaries facilitating the transactions 
      such as banks like the normal monetary system and parties remain completely anonymous. This allows users to buy and 
      sell things with little to no fees and is the main reason why interest in crypto is growing every year 
      (Hassani et al. 2018). <br><br>
      
      For these transactions to function and maintain security, a blockchain is used. A blockchain is basically a digital 
      storage of transactions. These transactions are replicated and sent to a network of nodes to record all the information,
      verify it, and then create a block which is added to the chain. A block in a blockchain stores a certain number of 
      transactions, then another block is created and distributed to all participants in the node network (Duggan 2022). 
      Each transaction must be verified through digital signatures from each party involved in the transaction. These 
      signatures are in the form of private and public keys. The keys are unique identifiers for each party which acts like a 
      password and once each party has entered their keys the transaction is sent to all verification nodes. <br><br>
      
      These nodes are operated by people that have been incentivised to verify transactions with the potential for rewards, 
      they are known as crypto miners (Duggan 2022). Crypto mining is where you get specialised computers to conduct calculation
      which are used to record and verify every new crypto transaction. Mining is essentially a race between all participants. 
      Each time a transaction occurs it is sent to nodes for verification. To verify the transactions, you need to guess a hash, 
      which is a 64-digit hexadecimal number. Whoever guesses the number first updates the blockchain with a new block containing 
      the newly verified transactions and in return they also receive a bitcoin or a unit of the cryptocurrency they are mining 
      (Coinbase n.d). As the blockchain is shared between all nodes in the network, it makes it hard for fraudulent activity to 
      occur because everyone can see the transaction, and everyone is trying to verify it. <br><br>

      The spike in crypto popularity has given rise to new lending, borrowing and trading opportunities known as DeFi. DeFi or 
      decentralized finance offers financial services much like banks but in the form of cryptocurrency. This is becoming more 
      popular because it often reduces the fees and commissions you would otherwise pay if you went through a bank 
      (Siripurapu and Berman 2023). The popularity of cryptocurrency has produced growing concerns within governments as the currency 
      has no regulations. With no regulations the door to criminal activity is wide open with no way to track transactions to the 
      individuals. <br><br>
      
      The federal reserve bank is considering making their own form of digital currency that acts very similar to cryptocurrency with 
      an attempt to add some regulation to reduce risks (Siripurapu and Berman 2023). The problem with this idea is that the popularity 
      comes from the fact that cryptocurrency is decentralised (Hassani et al. 2018). So, a form of digital currency produced by the 
      centralised bank may not be welcomed by already users of crypto. Cryptocurrencies are also increasing in acceptance by the retail 
      industry, with more retailers accepting crypto as payment for goods and services (Finance Magnates 2023). If the trend continues 
      it is going to put more pressure on existing financial institutions to come up with a response or risk being pushed out of the market. <br><br>

      <strong>What is the likely impact? </strong><br>

      Some impacts of the rise of crypto are that it has created a platform for criminal activity such as ransomware attacks, which 
      involve shutting down networks and demanding payment to restore them and drug cartels laundering money through virtual currencies, 
      utilising the anonymous nature of the transactions. The reaction to these activities by the US government is to monitor the 
      transactions of crypto back to the US dollar (Siripurapu and Berman 2023). This negative impact will see the need for authorities 
      to find new ways of being able to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies. <br><br>
      
      Another impact is user error. While it's said that blockchains are impossible to hack, your crypto wallet is only as safe as 
      your seed phrases. Seed phrases are generated by your crypto wallet and then are used to derive your private keys which allow 
      you to make a transaction (Duggan 2022). If someone was to acquire these phrases, for example, if you write them down and someone 
      finds it, then that person will be able to use those phrases to steal all your currency. If you were to forget these phrases, then 
      you would not be able to access your crypto and it is all essentially worthless. Wallets can also be “cold” which is the closest 
      you can get to physically holding the currency. This involves depositing your crypto into a physical hardware device which is then 
      turned off when you are not using it (Duggan 2022). If something were to happen to this cold wallet, then all the currency inside 
      is lost. <br><br>
      
      In contrast to your standard wallet with your bank card, if you lose your bank card, you can contact your financial institute report 
      it stolen and have a new card delivered within a week. In my personal experience when money has been stolen out of my bank account, 
      my financial institute has refunded the amount in full. If someone steals your wallet, has your passwords and spends your currency, 
      there is no way of recovering any of it. With these points in mind the people that will be impacted firstly are households and 
      businesses looking to loan, lend or invest money. With the growth in DeFi it is likely that more people will transition from regular 
      financial institutions for the cheaper fees and commissions. The financial institutions themselves will also be impacted, if they 
      lose more customers then they may cut employees due to lower demand for services. Finally, law enforcement will be impacted with a 
      growing need for more eyes on the crypto criminal element, so as potential jobs are lost in the financial sector, there would be 
      potential job growth in law enforcement. <br><br>

      <strong>How will this affect you? </strong><br>

      On an individual level the impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies are going to be quite small. This will affect people differently 
      according to how tech savvy they are. <br><br>
      
      Starting with the young generation, they have grown up with technology and know how to search the web and network with peers to figure 
      out how to use crypto wallets and any security precautions needed. We, the young generation, have grown up in a world where everything 
      is online, we already know how to contactless pay and live cash free, so if the world were to move more in the crypto direction, 
      it will not affect us too much. <br><br>
      
      Middle-aged society may be a little more affected. Most of the middle-ages people I know can be quite stubborn with the old way of 
      doing things, so they might hang on to the old way, not participate in learning the new technology and potentially lack security for 
      their wallets if crypto became the mainstream currency. <br><br>
      
      The last group of people to think of in the scope of changing to crypto is the elderly. I know from speaking to elderly from my family 
      that they are more likely to be targeted by scammers through emails and texts with links. So, if the elderly are targets now with the 
      current banking and financial system, you can imagine how they will be targeted in a cryptocurrency world. I know some elderly people 
      that barely know how to turn their phones on, and we expect them to be able to use seed phrases to generate keys just to buy some 
      groceries? Furthermore, as discussed earlier, if your crypto is stolen or you lose access, all the crypto is lost. You can’t trace the 
      theft back to anyone, you can’t recover the crypto from another device or wallet, it’s just gone. So, the elderly person makes one tiny 
      mistake which is likely to occur to some and they pay the ultimate price. <br><br>

      In my opinion the Gravy Seals team worked great together throughout this assignment. We divided tasks among
      ourselves and checked in with each other often to ensure that we met our deadlines. Our team members were very
      cooperative, easy going and pleasant to work with. Our communication was good, allowing for everyone to express
      their ideas and provide feedback when necessary. During our meetings we had good discussions with each other and
      our diverse backgrounds and experiences helped with the success on completing this assignment. <br><br>

      There were a few challenges along the way. As our team is scattered around Australia and we all have various work
      commitments we were not always able to meet as a team. We tried to find a time that everyone was available to meet
      but were not always successful. Despite this, we overcame this by ensuring that our meetings were recorded and
      requested that members who were not present make comments on the recordings at their earliest convenience. The
      Gravy Seals team has been great to work with and I look forward to continuing to work with them on the next
      assignment. <br><br>

      <strong>Nathan:</strong><br>
      The group started off a little slow which was expected with an online group as we had to try and figure out the best 
      time to meet up for our weekly meetings. We intentionally allocated a small amount of work for the first week just 
      while we figured out a good meeting plan. By the time the second meeting happened though the gravy seals were in full 
      swing. We divided large segments of the report between the group members and set the one-week deadline. From this 
      point on the group worked like a well-greased machine with members not only finishing their tasks but also going out 
      of their way to start the next task. <br><br>

      Our meetings were short, but they got straight to the point as we had discussions leading into meetings addressing 
      what we were going to talk about. I enjoy our meetings as it creates a more friendly environment where we have had a 
      few laughs rather than just relying on texting back and forth which can be quite boring. I am overall happy that our 
      team got together and am excited to see how our team project will evolve leading into assignment 3. <br><br>
