        <p>The Gravy Seals are a collection of students studying Introduction to IT. The group are from all over
          Australia with different interests and hobbies. This section will introduce the team.</p>

        <h4>Angus Dobson - s3814798</h4>
        <p>Angus was born and raised in Australia and speaks both English and Japanese. Angus has a passion for plants,
          owning several expensive and rare varieties with a recent acquisition of a Monstera Borsigiana Albo. From a
          young age, Angus found he had a strong interest in IT. He loved pulling apart computers and putting them back
          together to see how they worked. This then lead him down the path of teaching himself programming and creating
          websites, game mods and applications.</p>
        <p>After high school in 2015, Angus enrolled in on-campus studies at UQ. A short time after he was approached by
          his previous employer with a job offer in the managed service provider field. He started out answering phones
          in a customer service role, then as he got more competent, he moved into a level 2 technician role in which he
          became a point of contact for his fellow workmates. Angus now works at a new company in a similar role.</p>
        <p>Angus has participated in online tests such as Myers-Briggs, Online Learning Style and Big Five Personality
          with results as follows. </p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Myers-Briggs:</strong> Commander (ENTJ-A)</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Style Test:</strong> 20% Auditory, 50% Visual, 30% Tactile (Visual Learner)</li>
          <li><strong>BigFive Personality Test:</strong> 65% Conscientiousness, 46% Agreeableness, 83% Openness To
            Experience, 71% Extraversion, 50% Neuroticism</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Keaton Neville – s3472678</h4>
        <p>Keaton is an Australian citizen who currently lives in Canada. He has a passion for music, with a key
          interest in Guitar. Additionally, Keaton loves writing code, which stems from his interest in IT that started
          early when he explored computers and began learning about writing software.</p>
        <p>Keaton has been working in the IT industry for 10 years, specialising in support roles and software developer
          roles.</p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Myers-Briggs test:</strong> Architect (INT-J)</li>
          <li><strong>Learning style assessment:</strong> Visual</li>
          <li><strong>Work style test:</strong> Organised, Sequential, Planned, Detail oriented</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reflecting on the above results, Keaton may prefer to work with team members who deliver their work over time
          instead of rushing at the last moment – placing a high value on organisation and planning in teams.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Nathan Plunkett – s4028499</h4>
        <p>Nathan grew up in country Victoria and moved to Melbourne's Eastern suburbs to finish high school. He has
          lived in numerous states going where the work took him. Nathan has a strong passion for health and fitness and
          adheres to a strict gym routine and meal plan. His interest in IT is to gain some fundamental knowledge in the
          field as all his work experience has been gained from construction and military where tech is used but not
          explained.</p>
        <p>Nathan’s experience in IT is on the other end of the experience. He has used advanced technological systems
          in his time in the military and construction but has never been in a role which is part of innovation and
          creation of the tech itself.</p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Myers-Briggs test:</strong> Commander (ENTJ-A)</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Style Assessment:</strong> Visual learner</li>
          <li><strong>Creativity test:</strong> Creativity score of 60.52, Average score is 62.73.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The implications of these tests suggest that Nathan is a rational thinker, efficient and strong willed with
          tendencies to be cold, ruthless and stubborn. He would prefer to have visual displays of information and video
          chats rather than reading text to learn. His creativity level is slightly below the average.</p>

        <h4>Nicholas Mamone – s3754759</h4>
        <p>Nicholas was born and raised in Sydney Australia and has family ties from Italy from which his grandparents
          migrated from 70 years ago. He loves travelling and has a passion for taking photos on his travels. He will
          also never turn down an invitation to have drinks with some mates. His interest in IT started in year 9 when
          he learnt to program robotics.</p>
        <p>In 2014 Nicholas started a digital agency business. This business builds websites and manages client online
          presence. The agency currently manages more than 50 clients.</p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Myers-Briggs:</strong> Consul (ESFJ-A)</li>

        <p>Jayson was born in Sydney Australia but currently lives in Tokyo, Japan. He has followed a few different
          career paths including becoming a Teacher, Tradesman, Police recruit, and now aiming toward an IT career. He
          speaks English and Japanese, though his Japanese writing is not as strong.</p>
        <p>Jayson has had a fascination with IT from a young age, starting with building his first computer at 12, he is
          now excited to put all his energy into this field.</p>
        <h5>Test Results:</h5>
        <ul>

      <h1 id="analysis-ideal-jobs">Analysis of Ideal Jobs</h1>
      <hr class="col-3 col-md-2 mb-5">
      <p>This section compares the ideal jobs for each team member, identifying common elements and individual
        differences. The ideal jobs span from UX/UI Designing to Software Engineering, Investment Analysis, and IT
        Coordination.</p>
      <p>Angus aims to be a UX/UI Designer, Keaton aspires to be a Principal Software Engineer, Nathan envisions himself
        as an Investment Analyst/Portfolio Manager, Nicholas sees himself as an IT Coordinator and Jayson aims to be a
        Backend Developer. Each role demands a unique set of skills and experiences.</p>
      <p>Despite the differences, a common thread across all the roles is the requirement for extensive experience in
        their respective fields. These roles also require strong attention to detail, collaboration skills, and the
        ability to manage and optimize systems or processes.</p>
      <p>The differences lie primarily in the specific skills needed. For Angus, he needs UX/UI best practices and
        design skills. Keaton requires experience in building software systems. Nathan's role demands financial
        expertise and investment experience. Jayson needs to aim towards more Software Development experience. Nicholas,
        on the other hand, needs experience in managing IT assets and producing IT reports and documentation.</p>
      <p>The analysis shows that although the ideal jobs vary, they all require significant professional experience,
        attention to detail, and strong collaboration skills. The distinct set of skills each team member aspires to
        acquire highlights the broad nature of IT and related fields. Each role has its unique demand but collectively,
        they reflect the rich diversity of the IT industry.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>UI/UX Developer </strong><br>
        <strong>Demand:</strong><br>
        Based on the data from industry.gov.au, labourmarketinsights.gov.au, and Burning Glass, there is a growing
        demand for
        UI/UX Developers. It is expected to increase from 64,100 jobs in 2021 to 78,100 jobs in 2026. Over 70% of
        workers in
        this field work full-time, indicating both the robust demand for the role and the viability of the job as the
        primary
        source of income.<br><br>

        <strong>Required skills:</strong><br>
        The average age of a UI/UX Developer is 35, and over 85% hold a degree in related fields. Essential general
        skills
        include problem-solving, active listening, and critical thinking. Key IT-specific skills involve proficiency in
        design
        software like Sketch and Figma, as well as languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Labour Market Insights,
        2023).
        <br><br>

        <strong>Reflection based on industry data:</strong><br>
        Exploring the industry data has solidified my interest in the UI/UX Developer role. The significant growth
        prospects,
        coupled with the prevalence of full-time positions, make it an appealing career path. Moreover, the blend of
        technical
        and interpersonal skills matches my capabilities and interests. Seeing that the average age of professionals in
        this
        field is 35 makes this an achievable mid-term career goal. This research has further ignited my enthusiasm for a
        career in UI/UX development. <br><br>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        <strong>Investment analyst/portfolio manager</strong><br>
        <strong>Demand:</strong><br>
        The demand in job roles like this are expected to grow in the next 3 years with growth projected to be from
        62,100 jobs in 2021 to 68,800
        jobs in 2026 (labour market insights, 2021). Labour market insights (2021) also show that 84% of the workers in
        these roles are working
        full-time hours. This suggests that not only is the demand for the job in good shape but also the number of
        hours involved in the job will
        be sufficient for it to be the sole income. <br><br>

        <strong>Required skills:</strong><br>
        The average age for people working in roles like these is 42 and over 80% of people working in the field hold at
        least a diploma.
        Some of the most sort after skills for these roles are reading comprehension, speaking, active listening and
        critical thinking
        (Labour Market Insights 2021). Some of the IT crossover skills required by these roles include but are not
        limited to, communication using
        media, telecommunications, and utilising electronics to record and document data (Labour Market Insights 2021).
        <br><br>

        <strong>Reflection based on industry data:</strong><br>
        After researching the job role in more detail, I can say that my interest in the job role has not changed. The
        growth indicated in the report
        and the large number of hours offered by such roles gives me the confidence to pursue this type of role as a
        career path. The average age of
        workers being 42 also helps with my goals as I can set myself a 10-year career goal to achieve this type of
        role. <br><br>

      <strong>Principal / Staff Software Engineer</strong><br>
      <strong>Demand</strong>
      <p>
        As the Principal and Staff titles in Software Engineering are usually based on seniority and not specific
        occupations – the following analysis will focus on the Software Engineer / Programmer occupation. From data
        dated 2021, growth of 27% is expected for software engineer roles in Australia by 2026 (Labour Market Insights,
        2021). Additionally, the unemployment rate for this role is below average, suggesting that there is strong
        demand for people with the necessary skills and experience to perform in this role.
      </p>
      <strong>Required Skills</strong>
      <p>
        Reflecting upon many current active job postings on Seek.com.au in the Developers and Programmers category each
        role is often specific to the technology used by the employer, but some common skills found on each of these
        postings include collaboration, strong analytical skills, and strong problem-solving skills. All job posting
        require hands on experience with at least one programming language. Interestingly, a small portion of job
        postings were not specific with which languages they were hiring for – suggesting that employers are willing to
        hire for language agnostic developers. Roles also required additional technical skills such as experience
        working with databases, infrastructure, or security.
      </p>
      <strong>Reflection on industry data</strong>
      <p>
        Reviewing the industry data alongside current job postings on Seek.com.au, it seems to suggest that the industry
        data last updated in 2021 is accurate, with developers and programmers being one of the categories with the most
        current job postings in the Information Technology category. Additionally, it is interesting to see that there
        is strong demand across not only Full Stack Developer roles, but also Front-End Developer roles and Back End
        Developer roles.

        <strong>Security Ops:</strong><br>
        A day in the life of a cyber security analyst starts a lot like most jobs, checking emails for any priority
        tasks. Morning meetings are incorporated
        into the day to day to collaborate with the team and see how everyone is traveling with their tasks. The types
        of projects a cybersecurity analyst
        will work on varies, some may answer calls from existing clients and investigate problems/implement fixes. Other
        jobs can be working on benchmark
        security protocols specific to a project or client and make them available online. Throughout the day analysts
        will check the Endpoint Detection &
        Response (EDR) which monitors the traffic on the network for any malicious activity. As an analyst continues to
        improve their skills, they can advance
        in their career to start working on firewalls and switching and routing. This is usually configuring the
        firewalls, switches and routers and optimising
        their effectiveness (Day In The Life Of A Cyber Security Analyst. It's Probably Not What You Thought, Or Is

        As uncovered in the industry insights section of this report, the role of a Software Engineer is incredibly
        varied depending on the company they work for, the industry they’re in and what type of software development
        they do. Typically, a Software Engineer works as an individual contributor, taking on multiple tasks they have
        either been assigned by their manager or through a central project management and collaboration software tool
        such as Jira or Trello. The types of tasks a developer might do include implementing feature requests,
        investigating and solving bugs in software, writing documentation, and designing and architecting new software
        systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Software Engineers and Developers are the individuals writing code and implementing features and bug
        fixes, taking a software project from ideation to the end user is not single handedly performed by developers,
        with interactions by UI / UX Designers, Product Managers and Project Managers all common. The most common type
        of challenge experienced by people working as software developers is solving complex bugs that are hard to
        reproduce, or when a project is taking longer to complete than expected and having to spend some time working
        later than expected to meet the deadline. In some of the videos reviewed, interviewing candidates was often
        referenced in their day-to-day activities, affirming that there is a lot of demand from employers to hire people
        into these roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many companies who employ software engineers have introduced flexible working arrangements including working
        from home or hybrid work. This means that software engineers and the other people they interact with often have
        the freedom to work from where they are most comfortable, with a mix of working from home and spending some time
        in the office for some of the week being anecdotally a common choice.
      </p>

      <strong>Network Engineer</strong>
      <p>
        Network Engineers play an important role in ensuring the network infrastructure is operating effectively within their organisation.
        They can work directly for an organisation, or they can work for a specialised service provider who works with multiple organisations.
        This can be a demanding and varied role, with network outages meaning their organisation or clients are unable to work effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with all IT roles, change is expected, and the role of a Network Engineer is no different. People within these roles are expected to stay
        up to date with the latest technology, trends, and advancements in the industry. Fortunately, vendors who provide networking products often have
        certification programs which engineers can take advantage of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike other IT roles, Network Engineers have a varied work location, some will work either from home or their office exclusively,
        while others will visit data centres and client offices to install and diagnose issues with networking hardware, often interacting with
        other technical professions within IT while doing so including System Administrators and Security Operations professionals.

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        In modern times, technology has been integrated into virtually every aspect of life, including meal planning and
        grocery shopping. Through the development of innovative applications, meal planning and shopping have been
        streamlined to meet the needs of the fast-paced lifestyle that characterizes modern society. The project idea
        proposed, Dinnerizer, seeks to enhance this experience by incorporating novel features into a meal planning
        application, providing a comprehensive solution to meal planning and grocery shopping.
      </p>

      <h4>Overview of the Project</h4>
      <p>
        "Dinnerizer" is a dynamic meal planning solution designed for both desktop and mobile platforms. The application
        presents a wide variety of dinner options tailored to the user's preferences, dietary restrictions, desired
        cuisine styles, and specific ingredients to aid in reducing food waste. Dinnerizer not only generates
        comprehensive recipes but also compiles an organized shopping list for user convenience. The overarching aim is
        to ease daily dinner decision-making, promote diversity in meals, minimize waste, and enhance the overall
        cooking experience for a broad range of users, including those with disabilities.
      </p>

      <h4>Motivation and Objectives</h4>
      <p>
        Dinnerizer stems from the common, everyday challenge of deciding what to cook. This daily conundrum often leads
        to repetitive meals, unhealthy takeaway options, and food wastage. By providing varied meal suggestions and a
        meticulously compiled shopping list, Dinnerizer promotes home cooking and healthier dietary habits. The main
        objective is to create a valuable tool that improves lifestyle by making the process of meal planning more
        efficient, enjoyable, and accessible for all users, irrespective of their dietary preferences or physical
        abilities.
      </p>

      <h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>
        Dinnerizer is a comprehensive application with an extensive recipe database managed using SQLite for improved
        scalability and search functionality. The user experience is tailored for simplicity, with a keen focus on
        accessibility, accommodating users with visual impairments or other disabilities. The application implements a
        feature to include specific ingredients in the meal recommendations, aiming to help users reduce waste. With a
        continuous feedback loop with users, the application will be iteratively improved based on users' needs and
        suggestions, making it a truly user-centric solution.
      </p>

      <h4>Tools and Technologies Used</h4>
      <p>
        Dinnerizer will leverage Java due to its wide-ranging libraries and cross-platform capabilities. JavaFX will be
        utilized for crafting a user-friendly interface, and SQLite will serve as the efficient data management
        solution. Java's built-in I/O libraries will be used for effective data manipulation. Other libraries may be
        explored to facilitate exporting shopping lists either as printable PDFs or directly sent to users' emails.
      </p>

      <h4>Skills Required</h4>
      <p>
        The development of Dinnerizer requires a team skilled in Java programming and experienced with JavaFX for GUI
        design. Knowledge of SQLite for efficient data management is essential. The team should also possess a sound
        understanding of user interface design principles, including accessibility features. The ability to conduct user
        research and usability testing, respond to feedback, and iteratively improve the application will be crucial to
        its successful development and user reception.
      </p>

      <h4>Projected Outcomes</h4>
      <p>
        Upon completion, Dinnerizer will serve as a valuable tool that simplifies meal planning and offers a structured
        approach to grocery shopping. By alleviating decision fatigue, Dinnerizer will facilitate a diverse range of
        meals, promoting healthier home-cooked diets. Efficient grocery shopping could also mean less waste and
        cost-saving. As a future-oriented application, it will include plans for user feedback, potential monetisation
        considerations, and marketing plans to ensure that the application is continuously improved and relevant to its
        users.
      </p>

      <h4>Innovation and Uniqueness</h4>
      <p>
        The Dinnerizer application is set apart by its commitment to reducing waste by suggesting meals based on
        specific ingredients and promoting varied and diverse meals. Its dedication to accessibility ensures its
        usability across a wide demographic, including visually impaired and physically disabled individuals. The
        inclusion of a continuous feedback loop and the use of lightweight databases for improved scalability and search
        functionality adds a layer of innovation to this project. Dinnerizer goes beyond

      <hr class="col-3 col-md-2 mb-5">
      <h4>Angus:</h4>
      <p>
        I feel as though we have worked together well as a group and contributed fairly, where needed. Early on we were
        quick to form our group and have an initial meeting which lead to distributing the assignment equally and laying
        the groundwork for fostering a respectful environment where differing opinions were welcomed and discussed
        constructively. Reflecting on our journey, I am proud of the progress we've made, not just in assignment
        completion, but in personal growth and improved team dynamics.
      </p>

      <h4>Nicholas:</h4>
      <p>
        In my opinion the Gravy Seals team worked great together throughout this assignment. We divided tasks among
        ourselves and checked in with each other often to ensure that we met our deadlines. Our team members were very
        cooperative, easy going and pleasant to work with. Our communication was good, allowing for everyone to express
        their ideas and provide feedback when necessary. During our meetings we had good discussions with each other and
        our diverse backgrounds and experiences helped with the success on completing this assignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were a few challenges along the way. As our team is scattered around Australia and we all have various
        work commitments we were not always able to meet as a team. We tried to find a time that everyone was available
        to meet but were not always successful. Despite this, we overcame this by ensuring that our meetings were
        recorded and requested that members who were not present make comments on the recordings at their earliest
        convenience. The Gravy Seals team has been great to work with and I look forward to continuing to work with them
        on the next assignment.
      </p>

      <h4>Nathan:</h4>
      <p>
        The group started off a little slow which was expected with an online group as we had to try and figure out the
        best time to meet up for our weekly meetings. We intentionally allocated a small amount of work for the first
        week just while we figured out a good meeting plan. By the time the second meeting happened though the gravy
        seals were in full swing. We divided large segments of the report between the group members and set the one-week
        deadline. From this point on the group worked like a well-greased machine with members not only finishing their
        tasks but also going out of their way to start the next task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our meetings were short, but they got straight to the point as we had discussions leading into meetings
        addressing what we were going to talk about. I enjoy our meetings as it creates a more friendly environment
        where we have had a few laughs rather than just relying on texting back and forth which can be quite boring. I
        am overall happy that our team got together and am excited to see how our team project will evolve leading into
        assignment 3.
      </p>

      <h4>Keaton:</h4>
      <p>
        I felt that our group the Gravy Seals has worked well together – coordinating times between 5 people across
        Australia is no easy feat with different time zones, schedules and lifestyles all playing a part. We had a great
        mix of both synchronous engagement and asynchronous engagement – allowing everyone to participate in whichever
        way they felt the most comfortable. Surprisingly, each team member showed initiative and was able to carry a
        portion of the project on their own without being directed, which is a breath of fresh air compared to some past
        experiences in group projects. While we all have different schedules, we’re all invested in making our deadline.
      </p>

      <h4>Jayson:</h4>
      <p>
        In my opinion this group was very organised with strong leadership by Angus and strong daily updates by Keaton
        when leading up to the submission which helped all people stay on track. All the large sections were split up in
        order to assign a fair workload to each member of the team. It was also great that meetings were kept short and
        concise so that if a meeting was missed by a member, they could look at the recording and obtain all the
        important information clearly and easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were set with challenges as any group should be, particularly being time zone issues and late work shifts, to
        which I am an offender. However, with strong leadership and positive attitudes we managed to stay on track and
        stay as communicative as possible given the circumstances.
      </p>

      <h4>Collective Reflection:</h4>
      <p>
        Overall, the Gravy Seals team had a successful working experience throughout the assignment. The team formed
        quickly, and self-organised to schedule meetings to start the project. The team found working together to be a
        positive experience, with members reflecting that each team member contributed fairly and were able to not only
        complete their assigned tasks, but also ensure the project was moving forward. The team checked in regularly
        asynchronously on Teams and met twice a week. Our effective communication allowed us to meet our deadline and
        foster a cooperative working environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, it was a slower start as we navigated scheduling an initial meeting that worked for everyone's
        schedule. However, we were able to make a start on our project by filling in various sections from Assessment 1
        whilst we waited to meet. Once we established our meeting schedule and started allocating our work, the team was
        able to complete individual tasks assigned and show imitative to ensure the project was progressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        One surprising aspect of our collaboration was the individual initiative demonstrated by our team members. We
        have all had past experiences of group projects where only one or two members are pulling all the weight, but in
        this project, everyone had an equal share and were bought into the success of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lessons learned from this project include the importance of communication, especially when everyone is on a
        different schedule and has their own life commitments outside of schooling. We also learned that people work
        effectively in different ways and allowing each team member the space to work in the way that best suited them
        paid off for our team.
